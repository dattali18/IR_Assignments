bbc_272,yes israel had chosen to attack on the birthday of irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who turned 85 today,pro-israeli
bbc_272,but if the strike was against military targets that were perhaps associated with irans attack on israel last weekend  such as an airbase or drone factory or missile storage facility  then that could be seen as the restrained response israels western allies were looking for,pro-israeli

bbc_272,israels farright national security minister itamar ben gvir said a few days ago he wanted israel to go berserk in response to irans attack,pro-israeli

bbc_272, there have been reports that some ultraorthodox religious leaders had been cautioning the war cabinet about striking without us support potentially giving mr netanyahu cover for a limited attack on iran,pro-israeli

bbc_272,i am not recommending we destroy their nuclear facilities but if they did i wouldnt have a problem with it,pro-israeli
bbc_272, but not all israelis share that view,pro-israeli
bbc_272,it also found that only 28 of people supported military action if it led to a larger overall war with 34 saying they were opposed with a sizeable 38 saying they did not know,pro-palestinian

bbc_273,israel has not confirmed it was behind any of these attacks,pro-israeli
bbc_273,he said the reported missile strike was also fairly near to where we believe iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons so perhaps a nod to that,pro-israeli
bbc_273,the israeli strike was very much a demonstration of capability and perhaps intent he said noting that almost all of the more than 300 drones and missiles iran fired at israel last weekend had been intercepted while israel had fired one perhaps two missiles at a target and caused damage,pro-israeli
bbc_273,iranian officials were playing the attack down he said because they did not want to publicise israels success in getting through irans antiquated air defence systems,pro-israeli
bbc_273,israel militarily vastly overmatches iran and this is a demonstration of that he said,pro-israeli
bbc_273,iran would far more like to fight in the shadows using its terror groups and proxies rather than go toetotoe with israel conventionally where it knows it would get a real hammering,pro-israeli
bbc_273,there have been telephone contacts between the leadership of russia and iran our representatives and the israelis,pro-israeli
bbc_273,we made it very clear in these conversations we told the israelis that iran does not want escalation mr lavrov told russian radio,pro-israeli
bbc_273,mr de brettongordon said iran had slightly restored pride after attacking israel last weekend following the suspected israeli missile strike on its consulate in syria on 1 april and did not want to escalate further,pro-israeli
bbc_273,it knows that israel is absolutely determined and seems to have the backing of the us and others,pro-israeli
bbc_273,iran cant really rely on much help perhaps a little bit from russia which is very keen to keep the focus on the middle east and not ukraine but apart from that it is a little bit isolated he said,pro-israeli
bbc_274,he was told by police his presence was causing a breach of peace in a video posted online,pro-israeli

bbc_274, another officer said you will be escorted out of this area so you can go about your business go where you want freely or if you choose to remain here because you are causing a breach of peace with all these other people you will be arrested,pro-israeli
bbc_274,mr falter said despite being told repeatedly that london is safe for jews when these marches are taking place my interactions with police officers last saturday show that the met believes that being openly jewish will antagonise the antiisrael marchers and that jews need protection which the police cannot guarantee,pro-israeli
bbc_274,instead of addressing that threat of antisemitic violence the mets policy instead seems to be that lawabiding jewish londoners should not be in the parts of london where these marches are taking place,pro-israeli
bbc_274, in the statement of apology that was issued first met police assistant commissioner matt twist said the video posted by the campaign against antisemitism will further dent the confidence of many jewish londoners which is the opposite of what any of us want,pro-israeli
bbc_274,the use of the term openly jewish by one of our officers is hugely regrettable,pro-israeli

bbc_275,this time their main target was the storied central province of isfahan which is celebrated for its stunning islamic heritage,pro-palestinian
bbc_275,of late however the province is more famous for the natanz nuclear facility the isfahan nuclear technology centre and a major air base which was used during irans 14 april attack on israel,pro-israeli
bbc_275,so a limited operation seems to have carried a powerful warning x0080x0093 that israel has the intelligence and assets to strike at will at irans beating heart,pro-israeli
bbc_275,it is a message so urgent that israel made sure it was sent before rather than after the start of the jewish passover as was widely predicted by israel watchers,pro-israeli
bbc_275,us officials have also indicated that israel targeted sites such as irans air defence radar system which protects natanz,pro-israeli
bbc_275,there is still no confirmed account of its success,pro-palestinian

bbc_313,this was the first time iran and israel had attacked each other directly,pro-israeli
bbc_313,some analysts say the iranian attack was the largest combined missile and drone assault ever  bigger than anything russia has levelled against ukraine,pro-israeli
bbc_313,most of the 300plus iranian drones and missiles were shot down or failed en route,pro-israeli
bbc_313,but i watched from our office in jerusalem as the night sky was lit up by israeli air defences trying to bring down the ballistic missiles flying overhead,pro-israeli
bbc_313, yet some in the west think positives can be drawn from the attack on 13 april and israels limited retaliation last week,pro-israeli
bbc_313,they argue it was a huge intelligence success to predict the iranian strike that the defence of israel was an outstanding example of allied military cooperation and that both iran and israel learned how to climb down the escalatory ladder,pro-israeli
bbc_313,i am told the us learned about irans plans on the wednesday morning before the attack on saturday evening,pro-israeli
bbc_313,and crucially they discovered the scale of irans ambition,pro-israeli
bbc_313,we got wind that irans response would be at the top end of expectations said one highlevel western source,pro-israeli
bbc_313,their fear  once they were aware of the scale of irans plans  was the risk of an escalatory regional war if israel had no choice but to retaliate hard,pro-israeli

bbc_313,emile hokayem from the international institute for strategic studies think tank said the operation revealed how much israel had to rely on allies for its defence,pro-israeli
bbc_313,he also wondered whether israel would have enough air defence missiles needed for a higher intensity conflict,pro-israeli
bbc_313,as weve seen in the war between ukraine and russia it matters how much of the good stuff you have in stock he said,pro-israeli

bbc_313,israel showed it could retaliate modestly targeting air defences in central iran and using a small attack to signal a bigger capability namely that it could hit iran where and when it wanted,pro-israeli
bbc_313,i am told iran may even have been tipped off about israels retaliation,pro-israeli
bbc_313,the attack probably helped iran identify the relative strengths and the weaknesses of the israeli air defence system said the institute for the study of war,pro-israeli
bbc_313,in an essay for foreign affairs afshon ostovar from the foreign policy research institute says the scale of irans attack shows it is no longer convinced by a policy of restraint,pro-israeli
bbc_313,iran hoped to land an impressive blow against israel,pro-israeli
bbc_313,he cites israels failure to realise the consequences of its decision to kill several elite iranian revolutionary guards corps irgc commanders in irans consulate in damascus,pro-israeli
bbc_313,these two countries dont talk to each other,pro-palestinian

bbc_314,this was the first time iran and israel had attacked each other directly,pro-israeli
bbc_314,some analysts say the iranian attack was the largest combined missile and drone assault ever  bigger than anything russia has levelled against ukraine,pro-israeli
bbc_314,most of the 300plus iranian drones and missiles were shot down or failed en route,pro-israeli
bbc_314,but i watched from our office in jerusalem as the night sky was lit up by israeli air defences trying to bring down the ballistic missiles flying overhead,pro-israeli
bbc_314, yet some in the west think positives can be drawn from the attack on 13 april and israels limited retaliation last week,pro-israeli
bbc_314,they argue it was a huge intelligence success to predict the iranian strike that the defence of israel was an outstanding example of allied military cooperation and that both iran and israel learned how to climb down the escalatory ladder,pro-israeli
bbc_314,i am told the us learned about irans plans on the wednesday morning before the attack on saturday evening,pro-israeli
bbc_314,and crucially they discovered the scale of irans ambition,pro-israeli
bbc_314,we got wind that irans response would be at the top end of expectations said one highlevel western source,pro-israeli
bbc_314,their fear  once they were aware of the scale of irans plans  was the risk of an escalatory regional war if israel had no choice but to retaliate hard,pro-israeli
bbc_314,so a mixture of good intelligence gathering and private iranian signalling which the us denies took place gave israel and its allies time to prepare,pro-israeli
bbc_314,the roles played by jordan and saudi arabia are still not fully clear,pro-palestinian
bbc_314,the saudis are thought to have provided information to the us and kept an eye on any threat from iranianbacked armed groups in yemen,pro-israeli

bbc_314,it was an extraordinarily successful tactical operation said the security source,pro-israeli
bbc_314, some have also argued this could be the start of a new regional alliance against iran,pro-israeli
bbc_314,emile hokayem from the international institute for strategic studies think tank said the operation revealed how much israel had to rely on allies for its defence,pro-israeli
bbc_314,he also wondered whether israel would have enough air defence missiles needed for a higher intensity conflict,pro-israeli
bbc_314,as weve seen in the war between ukraine and russia it matters how much of the good stuff you have in stock he said,pro-israeli
bbc_314,mr hokayem also dismissed the idea this crisis marked the beginning of a new regional military alliance,pro-israeli
bbc_314,were not at the cusp of a new era he said,pro-israeli
bbc_314,arab states have cooperated because primarily they want to avoid a regional confrontation,pro-palestinian
bbc_314,they dont want stuff flying and exploding in their skies,pro-palestinian
bbc_314, the second claim by optimists is that iran and israel have learned from this experience,pro-israeli
bbc_314,they say both countries  for once  communicated their intentions accurately they realised they could deescalate without losing face and they both had a scare that will reestablish mutual deterrence,pro-palestinian
bbc_314,iran may have attacked israel but it warned allies of its intent and signalled early it was a oneoff,pro-israeli
bbc_314,israel showed it could retaliate modestly targeting air defences in central iran and using a small attack to signal a bigger capability namely that it could hit iran where and when it wanted,pro-israeli
bbc_314,i am told iran may even have been tipped off about israels retaliation,pro-israeli
bbc_314,the attack probably helped iran identify the relative strengths and the weaknesses of the israeli air defence system said the institute for the study of war,pro-israeli
bbc_314,in an essay for foreign affairs afshon ostovar from the foreign policy research institute says the scale of irans attack shows it is no longer convinced by a policy of restraint,pro-israeli
bbc_314,iran hoped to land an impressive blow against israel,pro-israeli
bbc_314,he cites israels failure to realise the consequences of its decision to kill several elite iranian revolutionary guards corps irgc commanders in irans consulate in damascus,pro-israeli

bbc_315,mp amir almaamouri told shafaq news on saturday that the new law was a significant step in combating sexual deviancy given the infiltration of unique cases contradicting islamic and societal values,pro-palestinian

nyt_300,and in fact the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release was at the end of last november,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and it soon came to light that this was the latest israeli proposal that was apparently presented,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and the israeli public knew nothing about this,pro-israeli

nyt_300,and the phase that president biden outlined was essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,in other words that goal of total victory that netanyahu talks about biden is actually saying theyve accomplished it,pro-israeli
nyt_300,the israelis have accomplished it,pro-israeli
nyt_300, and says that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what does total victory mean,pro-palestinian

nyt_300,and as the news did begin to trickle out it really shook israel up,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and this leaves netanyahu in a great bind because for months hes really been playing for time and juggling competing interests and really not having to make a decision one way or the other on what comes next,pro-israeli
nyt_300,but after that there was just a kind of void and no news on the hostages or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and netanyahu is suddenly facing a very crucial choice,pro-israeli
nyt_300,so isabel you said that this is a very important moment for netanyahu that now he really is facing a choice,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and he said the actual proposal put forward by israel would allow israel to uphold these principles,pro-israeli
nyt_300,he wasnt exactly denying that this was an israeli proposal,pro-israeli
nyt_300,but the one thing missing from that statement was this declaration wed been hearing for months on end that the war wouldnt end until there was total victory,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,and so what is netanyahu up to here isabel,pro-israeli
nyt_300,israels government is formed of a coalition of parties,pro-israeli
nyt_300,netanyahus likud is the main party,pro-israeli
nyt_300,so netanyahu faces this real political danger on his right,pro-israeli

nyt_300,but we really might be getting to crunch time when it comes to his political lifeline here,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,so this is a pretty dramatic moment for netanyahu then right,pro-israeli
nyt_300,i mean hes under tremendous pressure from biden his biggest ally,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,staying alive politically or the end of the war and the hostages coming home,pro-israeli
nyt_300,netanyahu himself is facing the prospect of possible arrest warrants being put out against him from the international criminal court in the hague,pro-israeli
nyt_300,israel is in the dark on a genocide case in the international court of justice in the hague,pro-israeli
nyt_300,so isabel say netanyahu approves this proposal,pro-israeli

nyt_300,and naturally the knesset would vote to dissolve itself and set a date for a new election which would have to come within five months,pro-israeli
nyt_300,now usually a caretaker government thats a transitional one in that period before elections isnt supposed to make dramatic decisions for the country,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,but it does in a way rely on netanyahu deciding what israels course will be,pro-israeli
nyt_300,we might end up seeing something in between because i think netanyahu who is facing huge public pressure to bring back those hostages who still are alive would definitely want to move ahead with at least that first part of the deal that would see a six week temporary ceasefire in return for the most vulnerable hostages,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and it could be that we might see netanyahu wanting to proceed with this deal but only partially and then get to a point where it cant go further,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and netanyahu is probably very keenly aware of the american political timetable,pro-israeli
nyt_300,so this is a scenario in which he just basically runs out the clock,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,ok so there are a number of ways netanyahu could actually handle this,pro-israeli
nyt_300,but it certainly has crystallized the issues and brought them out into the light after months and months of murkiness that netanyahu was able to in a way hide behind and operate within,pro-israeli

nyt_300,today my colleague isabel kershner explains bidens gambit and the difficult choice it presents for israels leader benjamin netanyahu,pro-israeli
nyt_300,its wednesday june 5,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,many hostages are there,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and without taking control of that area the israelis felt they wouldnt have accomplished anything,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and they did in fact strike those two operatives and killed them with what they said were the smallest missiles that their jets could carry,pro-israeli
nyt_300,this fire ripped through the tents and ended up killing 45 civilians according to the gazan health authorities,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,and it was exactly the kind of disaster that everybody had feared if israel were to operate in this crowded southern dusty border town,pro-israeli
nyt_300,before i begin my remarks   president biden gives a speech,pro-israeli
nyt_300,israel has now offered  israel is offering a comprehensive new proposal,pro-israeli
nyt_300,its a road map to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and isabel what did he mean exactly by the israeli proposal,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and in fact the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release was at the end of last november,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and it soon came to light that this was the latest israeli proposal that was apparently presented,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and the israeli public knew nothing about this,pro-israeli
nyt_300,humanitarian aid would be flowing at a much greater level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate,pro-israeli
nyt_300,women and children vulnerable hostages a cease in hostilities for six weeks,pro-israeli
nyt_300,hes saying that out loud which is not something weve been hearing from israel at all at least publicly,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and that is moving ahead already to the day after the war which has been kept very vague by the israelis up to now,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and the phase that president biden outlined was essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,in other words that goal of total victory that netanyahu talks about biden is actually saying theyve accomplished it,pro-israeli
nyt_300,the israelis have accomplished it,pro-israeli
nyt_300, and says that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what does total victory mean,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,and even if you did presumably there would be many more palestinians who would come to replace them,pro-palestinian
nyt_300,its time to begin this new stage for the hostages to come home for israel to be secure for the suffering to stop,pro-israeli

nyt_300,and as the news did begin to trickle out it really shook israel up,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and this leaves netanyahu in a great bind because for months hes really been playing for time and juggling competing interests and really not having to make a decision one way or the other on what comes next,pro-israeli
nyt_300,but after that there was just a kind of void and no news on the hostages or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon,pro-israeli
nyt_300,and netanyahu is suddenly facing a very crucial choice,pro-israeli
nyt_300,so isabel you said that this is a very important moment for netanyahu that now he really is facing a choice,pro-israeli

nyt_537,so last thursday there was a deadly disaster involving civilians possibly the deadliest disaster since the war started nearly five months ago in which 118 palestinians were killed and more than 760 were wounded in gaza city,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,this happened in northern gaza the place that has been at war the longest,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,the un has been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but one of the main reasons is that israel itself has been very slow to approve permits and often denies permits for aid trucks and aid convoys to come in specifically to the north,pro-israeli
nyt_537,when israel does approve the permits and the aid trucks start their journeys theres multiple hurdles that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people,pro-israeli
nyt_537,some of these hurdles include the widespread destruction in gaza,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,theres vast damage across the gaza strip,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they cant keep going,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,the few aid trucks that do come in have had to either suspend their aid deliveries into the north or have not been able to deliver aid there,pro-israeli
nyt_537,the last time unrwa the un agency in charge of palestinian refugees tried to bring trucks to the north was nearly a month ago,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,another major aid provider the world food program said that they havent delivered aid there in over three weeks,pro-israeli
nyt_537,theres been increased calls on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the residents there,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so people started being very hopeful that more would come and ahead of the fourth delivery they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,they start getting closer to the crowds of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come,pro-israeli
nyt_537,they surround them,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,then at some point israeli soldiers start firing shots,pro-israeli
nyt_537,it ended with 118 palestinians dead and 760 injured,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,this is where the accounts diverge,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,so the israeli military said that it was trying to secure the convoy and it had tanks nearby to make sure that the convoy reached the area,pro-israeli
nyt_537,it did acknowledge that its troops had opened fire at the crowd but they said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troops and endangered their lives,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so the israelis dont deny actually shooting but they say it was more about controlling the crowd kind of as warning shots type thing and that this was not the way people actually died,pro-israeli
nyt_537,they say the way people actually died was suffocation or being crushed by the aid trucks themselves,pro-israeli
nyt_537,what did the gazan health authorities say,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,so the gazan health authorities have actually been calling this the flour massacre or the massacre of the hungry stomachs,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by israeli fire,pro-israeli
nyt_537,what have you guys found in your reporting,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,there was no sound,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,you saw people scramble and run but you didnt understand why,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but it did show hundreds of people circling around the trucks and hoping to catch a bag of flour,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,then suddenly we see people start to panic and run in multiple directions,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,then they released another clip in which we see two israeli tanks that are positioned about a quarter mile down the road,pro-israeli
nyt_537,then we see about a dozen bodies lying around them,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,and it also captured the sound of gunfire and showed multiple tracer rounds which is a special type of ammunition that helps troops fine tune their targeting when its dark,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,so although that did not conclude that the shots came from the direction of the israeli military it did add another layer of evidence,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so hiba it sounds like these videos are suggestive but not conclusive,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but what did the people you spoke to on the ground say the eyewitnesses and survivors and doctors you spoke with,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,we spoke to witnesses and survivors as well as doctors at the hospitals that have taken in the people who were wounded and killed,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,the doctor who runs one of the four main hospitals in the area that took in the casualties told me that out of the 13 people who were killed and the 170 people who were wounded that the hospital took in all of the injuries were of gunshot wounds,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,that account echoes the ones that weve heard from witnesses and people who were there who saw people get shot and fall to the ground next to them,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but in the chaos of everything people were not checking whos dead and whos wounded,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,they were just taking the flour and they were running for their lives,pro-palestinian

nyt_537,well actually they tried to stay in their home for as long as they possibly could until the ground fighting really basically reached their doorstep,pro-palestinian
nyt_537, israeli soldiers came to their building and they forced them out,pro-israeli
nyt_537,they took nothing with them like many other gazans,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but that never happened because israeli forces took up their home as a military base and they were there for two weeks she said,pro-israeli
nyt_537,now shes sheltering with 50 members of her extended family including children in a two bedroom apartment in the north,pro-israeli
nyt_537,well she told me that in the beginning of the war they still were able to find some things to buy and eat like rice and vegetables,pro-israeli
nyt_537,and the children were constantly hungry so they had to find an alternative,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but she said that the one that was the worst for her was the bird food,pro-israeli
nyt_537,she told me that one of her cousins sheltering with her loved to bake and she made really tasty sweets before the war,pro-israeli
nyt_537,she used the animal feed to make maftoul which is the palestinian version of couscous,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,so she was making it with the ground up animal feed,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,sometimes when those werent even available they would just give her gum to chew on and stop crying to silence her hunger,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,so i asked her if they had been able to get any aid since the war started,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so her brother had been sleeping on the beach in hopes that there would be aid dropped off here,pro-israeli
nyt_537,suddenly when the chaos erupted he just started seeing people dropping to the ground,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,he just saw people get shot and fall to the ground in front of him,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,he just took it and started running really fast,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but she said that he told her that the kid was stopped by local gang members who had attacked him and grabbed the bag of flour from him,pro-israeli
nyt_537,ghadas brother just kept running until he got home finally,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,again they were 50 people sheltering in one apartment,pro-israeli
nyt_537,she said that it was better but still not normal bread,pro-israeli
nyt_537,she said that shes seeing people kids who are rummaging through trash trying to find anything to eat,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so she said that people were still going back to that same distribution site,pro-israeli
nyt_537,she even said that more people were going back on the beach and waiting and camping out and sleeping there hoping for more aid to come,pro-israeli
nyt_537,because he was so hungry that he wanted to eat anything and risking his life for a bag of flour was worth it,pro-palestinian

nyt_537,today my colleague hiba yazbek on what we know about what happened and what it tells us about hunger in gaza,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,and for weeks weve been hearing about negotiations over a cease fire and a hostage exchange,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so last thursday there was a deadly disaster involving civilians possibly the deadliest disaster since the war started nearly five months ago in which 118 palestinians were killed and more than 760 were wounded in gaza city,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,this happened in northern gaza the place that has been at war the longest,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,the un has been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but one of the main reasons is that israel itself has been very slow to approve permits and often denies permits for aid trucks and aid convoys to come in specifically to the north,pro-israeli
nyt_537,when israel does approve the permits and the aid trucks start their journeys theres multiple hurdles that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people,pro-israeli
nyt_537,some of these hurdles include the widespread destruction in gaza,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,theres vast damage across the gaza strip,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they cant keep going,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,the few aid trucks that do come in have had to either suspend their aid deliveries into the north or have not been able to deliver aid there,pro-israeli
nyt_537,the last time unrwa the un agency in charge of palestinian refugees tried to bring trucks to the north was nearly a month ago,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,another major aid provider the world food program said that they havent delivered aid there in over three weeks,pro-israeli
nyt_537,theres been increased calls on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the residents there,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so people started being very hopeful that more would come and ahead of the fourth delivery they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,they start getting closer to the crowds of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come,pro-israeli
nyt_537,they surround them,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,then at some point israeli soldiers start firing shots,pro-israeli
nyt_537,it ended with 118 palestinians dead and 760 injured,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,this is where the accounts diverge,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,so the israeli military said that it was trying to secure the convoy and it had tanks nearby to make sure that the convoy reached the area,pro-israeli
nyt_537,it did acknowledge that its troops had opened fire at the crowd but they said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troops and endangered their lives,pro-israeli
nyt_537,so the israelis dont deny actually shooting but they say it was more about controlling the crowd kind of as warning shots type thing and that this was not the way people actually died,pro-israeli
nyt_537,they say the way people actually died was suffocation or being crushed by the aid trucks themselves,pro-israeli
nyt_537,what did the gazan health authorities say,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,so the gazan health authorities have actually been calling this the flour massacre or the massacre of the hungry stomachs,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by israeli fire,pro-israeli
nyt_537,what have you guys found in your reporting,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,there was no sound,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,you saw people scramble and run but you didnt understand why,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,but it did show hundreds of people circling around the trucks and hoping to catch a bag of flour,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,then suddenly we see people start to panic and run in multiple directions,pro-palestinian
nyt_537,then they released another clip in which we see two israeli tanks that are positioned about a quarter mile down the road,pro-israeli

nyt_558, music playing earlier this week the top prosecutor of the international criminal court requested arrest warrants for israels prime minister and its defense minister,pro-israeli
nyt_558,today my colleague jerusalem bureau chief patrick kingsley explains,pro-israeli
nyt_558,music playing so patrick earlier this week there was a pretty surprising announcement by the international criminal court in the hague,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,well on monday morning we were all taken by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the icc the international criminal court the top criminal court in the world,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and this was a massive bombshell,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,he has spent years working on human rights cases both defending people and also prosecuting in such cases,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,he was involved in tribunals related to the wars surrounding the breakup of the former yugoslavia rwanda,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,he investigated islamic state crimes in iraq,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,the icc and the icc prosecutor investigates and tries people who would not be pursued by the judicial system within their countries of origin,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,it steps in when it seems like the domestic authorities in any given country are not doing their job,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,i have just come from the border of the rafah crossing and we could see gaza at least we could see cranes that were on the territory of gaza,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and he also visited the rafah crossing between egypt and gaza talks to palestinians,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,at the ministry of justice in ramallah the chief prosecutor of the worlds highest court,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and he makes this very dramatic announcement in a video,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,my office has diligently collected evidence and interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses at the scene of at least six major attack locations,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and he walked through a long list of charges stemming from the extraordinary violence during that attack,pro-israeli
nyt_558,the taking of hostages as a war crime,pro-israeli
nyt_558,thats what it amounted to in his view,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and what about the charges against the israelis,pro-israeli
nyt_558,israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and minister of defense yoav gallant bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes,pro-israeli
nyt_558,but karim khan focuses not on the military actions of benjamin netanyahu and yoav gallant his defense minister but on the accusation of  starvation of civilians as a method of warfare,pro-israeli
nyt_558,these individuals through a common plan have systematically deprived the civilian population of gaza of objects indispensable to human survival,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and while that total siege was eased towards the end of october khan also notes that there have been continuing restrictions on essential supplies like food and medicine ever since,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,that starvation has caused and continues to cause deaths malnutrition dehydration and profound suffering among the population,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,my office charges netanyahu and gallant as coperpetrators and as superiors in the commission of these alleged crimes,pro-israeli
nyt_558,karim khan does not explain why he focuses on starvation rather than israels military tactics which he mentions only in passing,pro-israeli
nyt_558,but legal experts have said that its easier to prove that starvation was used as a method of warfare than it is to prove that there have been any specific crimes involved in any specific airstrikes,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and thats because under the rules of war and international law its not necessarily illegal in and of itself to kill civilians during wartime,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and thats why legal experts think that karim khan has gone after israel with the crime of starvation rather than focusing on their military operations,pro-israeli
nyt_558,but i suppose just thinking about our coverage patrick and the conversations you and i have had famine and starvation and a civilian population in extreme distress trapped in a small piece of territory is also not a small thing right,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,so these charges really seem to spell bad news for israel and for these two israeli leaders netanyahu and gallant,pro-israeli
nyt_558,yes it is a very dramatic moment in the view of some people a turning point and certainly we can say that it is one of the harshest rebukes of israels wartime conduct since october 7th,pro-israeli
nyt_558,music playing but within israel theres been a very different reaction,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and its not all bad news for benjamin netanyahu,pro-israeli
nyt_558,within israel the reaction has been very different,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and it means that at a time of rising domestic criticism of prime minister netanyahu across the political spectrum with only a very few exceptions everyone has rallied behind netanyahu and gallant,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and gantz is one of the first to come out with a condemnation of karim khan and a defense of the israeli government,pro-israeli
nyt_558,so this action by the prosecutor has kind of had the effect of actually closing divisions that were starting to appear in israeli society effectively bringing netanyahus critics kind of back into his camp or at least making it harder to criticize him,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and there have been broadly three criticisms from the israelis of the icc prosecutor,pro-israeli
nyt_558,israel in the eyes of israelis is fighting a righteous response to protect their citizens and to win back the liberty of the hostages that were captured on october 7th,pro-israeli
nyt_558,music playing this guy is out to demonize israel,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and netanyahu himself articulated some of the clearest versions of this argument when he went on american television,pro-israeli
nyt_558,he said it would have been as if after 911  thats like saying after 911 well im issuing arrest warrants for george bush but also for bin laden,pro-israeli
nyt_558, arrest warrants had been issued for both osama bin laden and george bush,pro-israeli
nyt_558,hes out to defame israel and hes also pouring gasoline  music playing the second criticism from israelis has been about process,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and israel contends that the prosecutor doesnt have the authority therefore to go after israeli political leaders,pro-israeli
nyt_558,israelis also say that khan didnt spend enough time assessing whether israel was itself investigating these allegations within its own judicial system,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and israelis are saying that khan didnt spend enough time investigating gallant and netanyahu,pro-israeli
nyt_558,so the israelis are saying look were trying to get to it but you just didnt give us enough time,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and theyve even said that khans team was supposed to be coming this very week to continue that conversation and assess whether israel was genuinely looking into these allegations by itself,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and that they misled israel by pretending that they would be making that assessment when in fact all along they were planning to request arrest warrants,pro-israeli
nyt_558,so for israeli officials theyre seeing it as a kind of activist thing as opposed to a neutral judicial decision,pro-israeli
nyt_558,the prosecutors office says that they have tried to sincerely engage with israel on this issue but that its become clear to them that israel does not seriously investigate this kind of crime,pro-israeli
nyt_558,so you said there are three elements to this,pro-israeli
nyt_558,it even denies that there is a famine or that the situation is on the point of a famine,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and while it accepts that its soldiers have obstructed and at times even killed aid workers it says that that obscures the fact that it coordinates every day in detail with aid groups to facilitate thousands of aid missions every month,pro-israeli
nyt_558,israel says it is,pro-israeli
nyt_558,it says that if it didnt check then some of these aid convoys might be smuggling in weapons or material that could be used to fight israel to kill israeli civilians,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and that therefore israel has no choice but to examine some of these goods going in,pro-israeli
nyt_558,ok so thats the israeli perspective,pro-israeli
nyt_558,how does the united states see the prosecutors request here,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,i mean the us obviously israels biggest ally,pro-israeli
nyt_558,well the american president president biden condemned it in no uncertain terms,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,he said the prosecutors decision was outrageous,pro-israeli
nyt_558,we know that humanitarian aid has been a major concern for this administration,pro-israeli
nyt_558,so why would biden be so opposed to something that really is calling out israel for this aid,pro-israeli
nyt_558,second of all they fear that this kind of criticism this kind of intervention will actually make israel less rather than more likely to bring the war to a halt because the feeling is that it will make israel more defensive and in turn batten down the hatches,pro-israeli
nyt_558,the third reason is that the united states historically has never been a particular fan of the international criminal court,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,we mentioned earlier that israel did not sign the treaty that created the icc,pro-israeli
nyt_558,well the united states did not do that either,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and thats in part because american leaders fear that having an international global court undermines american sovereignty,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and there is a fear that with the united states so active militarily in many parts of the world that membership of the court involvement in the court could pave the way for american soldiers being tried for acting on behalf of the united states,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,ok so the united states doesnt really like this court you know has troops in a lot of places doesnt want a court swooping in and prosecuting them when something goes wrong,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,israel is not a signatory,pro-israeli
nyt_558,if an arrest warrant is issued it means that any country thats a member of the international criminal court in theory should arrest any of these individuals if they enter their territory,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,that includes more than 120 countries all over the world much of europe latin america africa and so on,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,so the negotiations over the war can still continue but if netanyahu travels to france or to italy he could be arrested which is pretty wild,pro-israeli
nyt_558,the national authorities in any given country still have to make a choice about whether they want to follow through with it,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,but would those countries perhaps not arrest him out of deference to the united states,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,we are entering unchartered waters,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,so this is really isolating netanyahu in the world,pro-israeli
nyt_558,yes isolating netanyahu and to some extent israel itself,pro-israeli
nyt_558,it complicates israels ability to arm itself,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and it also could force the country to become ever more reliant on the united states as it becomes more of a pariah over its actions in gaza,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,which of course puts the united states in an even trickier position with an ally whos been pretty hard to be friends with of late,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,israel does still have its supporters many of them but were also now seeing during this war a level of criticism that goes above and beyond the kind that weve grown used to seeing directed at israel over the years,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and earlier this year we had a watershed moment when the international court of justice began hearing accusations of genocide against israel,pro-israeli
nyt_558,and this week several european countries recognized palestine as a state,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,so if the tsunami hasnt yet arrived we can at least say that the waves are getting stronger,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,music playing on wednesday the leaders of spain norway and ireland announced that they would recognize an independent palestinian state,pro-palestinian
nyt_558,and the city of uvalde texas has reached a settlement with most of the families of children who were shot by a gunman at robb elementary school in 2022,pro-palestinian

jp_103,following the 2013 national election arbel served as a legal adviser for shas as a legislation adviser to then knesset member and current labor minister yoav bentzur and as a chief of staff for deri,pro-israeli
jp_103,the jerusalem post interviewed arbel in his knesset office on april 8 and the first issue to be discussed was the ongoing crisis over the haredi exemption from idf service,pro-israeli
jp_103,as both a longtime haredi yeshiva student and a longserving idf reservist arbelrsquos perspective is important,pro-israeli
jp_103,his approach can be summarized as follows the idf has a real need for soldiers and haredi men who do not study torah fulltime should commit to idf or other national service,pro-israeli
jp_103,this fundamental premise is more important than the details of a specific haredi conscription plan he added,pro-palestinian
jp_103,furthermore arbel argued that enabling haredi men to serve in the idf while maintaining their lifestyle is a liberal value as well ndash idf service isnrsquot just a duty it is also a right,pro-israeli
jp_103,the idf currently does this ldquosufficientlyrdquo and should continue doing so he said,pro-israeli
jp_103,he stressed that yeshiva students who were not actually studying and who were ldquocatching a riderdquo on the blanket exemption should serve in the idf like all other citizens,pro-israeli
jp_103,arbelrsquos approach regarding torah study and idf service reflects a broader view on haredi education in general,pro-israeli
jp_103,this led arbel to wonder why they could not order new documents online and he worked with the defense and other authorities to begin providing this service whose pilot is set to begin at the end of april,pro-israeli

jp_103,in some rare cases there were also management problems such as certain families who won the municipal election refusing to provide services to other families,pro-palestinian
jp_103,arbel added that ldquogood thingsrdquo are happening in arab local authorities citing as an example the town jatt near haifa which elected in the recent municipal election a young engineer who is unaffiliated with large families,pro-palestinian
jp_103,this shows that residents understand the importance of proper governance aimed first and foremost at improving their daily lives,pro-palestinian
jp_103,ldquothe goal of local authorities is to break through cement ceilingsrdquo he said,pro-israeli
jp_103,ndash could serve as the basis for real social mobility which arbel said is ldquoone of the most significant tools in our national resilience,pro-israeli
jp_103,another notable initiative that arbel mentioned was creating an ldquoaliyah eligibility document,pro-israeli
jp_103,rdquo what happens arbel explained is that potential olim sometimes express interest in moving to israel but do not follow through with the process such that if they want to renew it later on they will have to start afresh,pro-israeli
jp_103,instead arbel proposed enabling these families to complete all of the necessary paperwork without actually making the move ndash and thus enabling them to make aliyah immediately in the future if they wish,pro-israeli
jp_103,but perhaps more important than his work in the interior ministry and his support of haredi enlistment is his sympathy for the families of the hostages,pro-israeli
jp_103,he said he is concerned by criticism that ministers had not met enough with the families of hostages since the war broke out and said that he meets at least once a week with a family,pro-israeli
jp_103,the meetings are difficult and the families are experiencing immense pain and anger but as a government minister arbel said he does not have the right to avoid the families,pro-israeli
