piece for MultiPiano which perform work on two piano for four six or eight hand with or without an orchestralev belief the time be particularly ripe for the work to resound from the concert hall and hopefully change mindset ndash and possibly make some difference to the dismal state of regional affairsldquowhen we start tour internationally with MultiPiano we see that people donrsquot know about Israelrsquos multiculturalism so we decide we want to perform something that would reflect the pluralist face of this countryrdquolevanon be up for that ldquoHe compose Land of Four Languages he

jp_2,be jerusalem mughrabi bridge in news to spark jordan crisis analysis this week a number of voice many of they link to Israelrsquos former rule Likud Party claim that the Mughrabi bridge which link the Temple Mount to an area near the Western Wall and be use by nonMuslims to visit the Temple Mount be in danger of collapse former transportation minister MK Miri Regev say ldquoit be forbid to wait another moment with the demolition of the bridge and the construction of an appropriate replacementrdquonbsp nbsp the concern about the bridge ostensibly date from a month ago when an engineerrsquos report say that the wood the bridge be construct with do not enable safe use of the bridge this raise question about why the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu didnrsquot replace or reinforce the bridge recently despite be in office for a decade how do a bridge suddenly become unsafe around the same time Israel get a new government why be there now a new potential crisis at the sensitive holy site do the crisis emerge precisely when the Kingdom of Jordan and Israel be work to repair tie Jordan be sensitive to any change to the status quo and previous attempt to alter the bridge have meet with protest and also conspiracy spread about alaqsa be in danger these kind of conspiracy have lead to conflict in the past include the recent Gaza warnbspnbsp nbsp so how do we get here in a temporary structure often call the Mughrabi bridge after an early ramp and neighborhood that once exist underneath the temporary bridge be close due to safety concern at the time report say that ldquoofficial close the Mugrabi Bridge on Sunday three day before the municipality deadline to close the ramp lead from the Western Wall plaza to the Temple Mount the Jerusalem city engineer Shlomo Eshkol have warn over the past year in a series of letter to the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation ndash which oversee the area ndash that the temporary bridge be unsaferdquonbsp nbsp Letrsquos recall what happen at the time year ago ldquoThe municipality originally set November as the deadline to destroy the bridge but Netanyahu intervene to stop the demolition worry about trigger riot across the arab world in the most recent letter send last week the municipality insist the entrance must be close to the public until a new bridge be builtrdquo Netanyahu choose to cancel the demolition of the bridge because of concern in Egypt and Jordan the Jerusalem Municipality try to close the structure on December nbsp oddly the issue then disappear from the headline somehow the unsafe bridge continue to exist with some modification in a new report emerge a new part of the bridge have be add ldquoerecte less than two week ago the bridge have not officially be open when Netanyahu order it be dismantle after it become clear that the project be not approve by the relevant authority and amid mount jordanian protestsrdquo once again the temporary bridge erect after the ramp collapse partially in have become permanent and any change be see as a ldquostatus quordquo issue threaten peace in the regionnbspnbspnbsp nbsp it appear that in and the Netanyahu government choose to forego change in order to maintain calm now suddenly there be call to remove the bridge by member of the same party that didnrsquot remove it for a decade this despite the fact that it be well know that previous change have always result in a crisis be this controversy about the bridge or create stumble block for the new government in tie with Jordan Jordanrsquos Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi have meet his israeli counterpart in what the Jordan Times call a ldquosemblance of normalityrdquo there be a new deal to supply Jordan with water Prime Minister Naftali Bennett have be outspoken on the importance of tie with Jordannbsp nbsp for Netanyahu the Kingdom of Jordan be always a sour point he run into many controversy with the kingdom date back to his time in office in the Netanyahu didnrsquot make progress on the plan to develop the Arava peace valley with Jordan and Jordan harshly slam Israel during the anniversary of the peace agreement between the country demand Israel return land that be part of the agreement in an incident with an israeli security guard in Jordan in which two Jordanians be kill lead to another crisis most recently Netanyahu cancel a short trip to the UAE on the eve of election after a stop in Jordan apparently be nix in addition Jordanrsquos crown prince cancel a trip to Jerusalem in March Relations be at their low point in memorynbspnbsp nbsp Netanyahu have slam Jordan in recent day critique the water deal and accuse Jordan of have tie to Iran the insinuation be that Jordan have transport oil from Iraq to Egypt and that somehow this help Irannbspnbsp nbsp it be in this context that there be rise call for the government to make change to the Mughrabi bridge any chance be likely to cause a crisis close the bridge would anger some of the Jews who visit the Temple Mount weekly it would also mean nonMuslims could not visit the historic area near the mosque and Dome of the Rock any change to the bridge would lead to complaint from Jordan unless there be coordinationnbspnbsp nbsp there be no doubt the bridge need to be safe both for those who use it and because it stretch over a part of the womenrsquos section of the Western Wall there be many question to be ask why this bridge issue be never responsibly address for more than a decade it appear convenient that suddenly those who be in office for many year and make no change now want it closed demolish change or remove like many thing that take place over the last decade in Israel where problem be manage or what some call ldquomowe the grassrdquo be do to postpone address major issue the bridge be a symbol of how Jerusalem and Israel be manage this crisis management mean postpone many major problem such as deal with Gazarsquos constant crisis to the issue face Bedouin in the Negev to ignore the crowding at Meron that lead to a disaster and then not investigate it the current government want to address the issue but stoke up issue like the Mughrabi bridge appear to be a way to create a crisis with Jordan precisely when Jordan and Israel be keen on work together again whether the kingdom might be interested in be flexible regard the bridge might be address but such status quo issue usually take time and be sensitive because of the position of the Palestinians and the Wakf and other authority and stakeholder the King of Jordan be meet the US president on July perhaps responsible policy regard the bridge will prevailnbsp nbsp

iranian training and knowledge help Hamas upgrade its missile and rocket with the result be show in this late round Iran hereby hit Israel indirectly as part of the ongoing conflict between they Israel return the favor by bomb iranian target inside Syria and by conduct covert operation against Iranrsquos nuclear program nbsp Israelrsquos most crucial national security concern be stop or at least delay the development of Iranrsquos nuclear program it be a top priority for Israel more important than any issue Israel have with Hamas or any other national security concern for that matter nbsp Talks between Iran the United States and other power about contain Iranrsquos nuclear program be ongoing Israel do not have much leverage in those negotiation but as long as Israel be occupy with Hamas Israel can not focus on what matter most handle iranrsquos nuclear program in that sense Hamas serve Iran even if Hamas fight Israel for its own reason this be another major reason why Israel should end the current campaign with Hamas nbsp Israel and the United States have close tie but the Biden administration do not have very friendly relation with the israeli government Israel need its american patron in order to reach the good outcome for the current round with Hamas Israel rely much more on the United States to make sure the talk with Iran will be effective at restrain Iranrsquos nuclear program nbsp if Israel annoy the Biden administration with respect to the Gaza Strip the United States might be less willing to listen to Israel about Iran the Biden administration lend Israel time in fight Hamas but it be clear the Biden administration want this campaign to subside if Israel insist on persist with this round it risk increase friction with the Biden administration the Gaza Strip have be under the rule of Hamas since nbsp Hamas due to its mismanagement and eagerness to confront Israel cause a deep economic and social crisis in the Gaza Strip some predict that this area might collapse drive thousand of desperate Palestinians to infiltrate Israel and ask for help obviously Israel do not prefer this outcome if Israel continue with this round the probability of further decline in the Gaza Strip increase nbsp many arab state oppose Hamas and some like those in the Gulf have tie with Israel arab state canrsquot openly support Israel in this round fear public opinion inside their country and across the arab world arab criticism of Israel be not as pronounce as it use to be but this can easily change for the bad the long this round be continue the high the burden of casualty amongst the palestinian population will reach force even arab state that have normalize relation with Israel to speak and maybe even to act against Israel nbsp all in all end the current

jp_54,could tank helicopter secure quiet in w bank with palestinians analysis some see the world in one or two dimension and other in three when Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich who also have a portfolio within the Defense Ministry respond to the palestinian terrorist attack in which two Jews be murder in Huwara in the northern West Bank by call for use tank and helicopter against the Palestinians he certainly be not think threedimensionallynor be National Security Minister Itamar BenGvir who pick a fight with the Shin Bet Israel Security Agency which recommend unseal the residence of a terrorist who kill three Jews early in FebruaryThese view be indicative of narrow thinking lesson from the Second Intifada and the Knife Intifada show that substantially increase IDF physical presence in West Bank area especially palestinian area be part of the necessary mix of ingredient for restore calm and securitybut that presence rarely involve tank and helicopter ndash blunt instrument for open battlefield or for target large concentrated enemy positionsthose position do not exist in the West Bank which do not have the massive volume of rocket other destructive weapon and wellstructure Hamas militia that exist in GazaWhy will not tank helicopter in the West Bank secure quiet with the PalestiniansThe Palestinian Authority while it might not control all area and might be turn a blind eye to terrorist element be actively avoid conflict with the IDF NonPA terrorist element do not pose anywhere near the same magnitude of threat as Hamas neither do they present a useful large target for tank or helicoptersmilitarily the tactic that work before and would likely work now if it need to be unleash would involve huge number of soldier go door to door with intelligence support from droneslikewise despite BenGvirrsquos attack on the Shin Bet the security agency have be a big supporter of house demolition to deter future terrorismHowever part of the Shin Betrsquos rationale be that Palestinians know in their heart of heart that the agency be focus on family who hold some joint responsibility for the terrorism of their family membersIn contrast the Shin Bet find that the Ramot terrorist from early this month be psychologically unstable and that the family do not assist he in any way and might even have try to temper his violent leaningsA house demolition in that case could just create more terrorist even accord to the Shin Bet because not a single palestinian would see it as legitimatebut the Second Intifada be also bring under control by the eventual completion of the West Bank security barrier to limit infiltrationsone problem in a dimension where use force can not solve everything ndash and tank and helicopter be useless and impractical to police a long border ndash be that as IDF source tell the Jerusalem Post complete those portion of the barrier where Palestinians be still sneak through into sovereign Israel could take another monthsAnd this doesnrsquot even address east Jerusalem where there be not any initiative be entertain that could handle the security situation Arabs from east Jerusalem travel freely in Israel even presume that nearly all of they arenrsquot look to act against Israel anyone with violent intention be unrestrained tank and helicopter be even less relevant theresundayrsquos terrorist attack occur in an overlap palestinian area where Palestinians and Israelis mix the least secure type of locationThe Knife Intifada be partially put down by israeli security force use social medium and drone surveillance to predict and prevent terrorist attack by ldquolone wolfrdquo attacker before they happen yet many say another ingredient to end the Second Intifada be Israelrsquos announce withdrawal from GazaIn contrast there be currently no diplomatic dimension or ldquocarrotrdquo on the table from Israel to follow a new Operation Defensive Shield or ldquostickrdquo such as thenprime minister Ariel Sharon usedIn parallel to demolish more house take away terroristsrsquo citizenship and call for capital punishment for terrorist the current government be also in negotiation with the PA Jordan and Egypt to try to calm the broad situation before it transform into another intifada part of the ldquodealrdquo that seem to have emerge include freeze unilateral action on both side for some monthsFor Israel this refer to new settlement and outpost whereas for the Palestinians it might have refer to legal move against Israel in the UN systemBut as those effort continue element of the coalition oppose any dialogue whatsoever with any Palestinians even though the Shin Bet believe dialogue be critical to restore security cooperation with the PAIn past year some intelligence official tell the Post that the PA have help Israel stop or more of terrorist attack against Israel ndash not insignificant number and tank and helicopter in the West Bank would not make thing quieter with Hamas in GazaTo date the current government have fail to convince Hamas to fully disconnect itself from issue with Palestinians in other conflict areasall of this come down to the idea that use force and more of it may absolutely be part of the equation to end the almost yearlong upanddown current wave of violencebut there will also likely need to be a ldquocarrotrdquo in there somewhere whether economic diplomatic or both might the new deal be enough in this area or be it inadequate to escape the current quagmireother ingredient could be the unfinished security barrier in the West Bank which will take time come up with a unique security solution to east Jerusalem security issue and figure out a way to restore deterrence with Hamas in GazaThis would mean the current government will need to try some new and creative idea on multiple playing field instead of only double down with populist slogan in one dimensionthere be many idea short of a messianic peace vision that can help restore calm and the late deal might help with that but tank and helicopter be either a tiny part or a nonexistent part of the solution

that offer these sort of combinationsarbel didnrsquot rule out give haredi teen the option of study Torah fulltime he himself study only Torah in his teen and complete matriculation requirement later on and the year of Torah study grant he a work ethic and analytic skill that serve he later on in life but such a system be not appropriate for everyone and should not be force on haredi teen who

these change lead to a learning process that lead to broad initiative not just relate to warthe three branch be the local authority immigration and citizenship and urban planning and developmentfollowe October the local authority require receive special power and fund especially those whose resident be attack andor evacuate on the issue of immigration and citizenship many of these evacuee leave their home without their passport or other identification paper and the ministry create roam emergency office that go to hotel in order to provide service for the evacuee finally on the issue of urban planning and development Arbel have the ministry pass temporary executive order to cut bureaucracy in order to speedily construct new school and medical center for the evacueesIn the day and week after the massacre some of the survivor be traumatize to the extent that they be not willing to leave their hotel room in order to meet with the roam immigration office this lead Arbel to wonder why they could not order new document online and he work with the defense and other authority to begin provide this service whose pilot be set to begin at the end of April wait time in Israel for immigration service such as renew a passport be notoriously long and the ability to order a new passport online could drastically improve this the idea to enable online documentation order be an example of how the ministryrsquos ad hoc adaptation to war need lead to broad initiative Arbel explainedHe say he also put a specific emphasis on service to arab municipalitiesldquoOn the day I enter office I say that we must understand that we be public servant of all of the citizen of Israel ndash those who vote for we and those who didnrsquot even those who be act against usrdquo Arbel saidHe

be not to be take for granteddeale with arab municipality include unique challenge ndash a major one for example be Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich refuse in to channel NIS million of funding due to the concern that it could end up in the hand of criminal organization Arbel confront Smotrich and succeed in get the fund through in some rare case there be also management problem such as certain family who win the municipal election refuse to provide service to other family Arbel add that ldquogood thingsrdquo be happen in arab local authority cite as an example the town Jatt near Haifa which elect in the recent municipal election a young engineer who be unaffiliated with large family this show that resident understand the importance of proper governance aim first and foremost at improve their daily livesArbel view local authority as key factor in bridge social gap ldquothe goal of local authority be to break through cement ceilingsrdquo he say socioeconomic gap in Israel be unacceptably high for a country the size of a district in California and correct investment by municipality such as in fundamental aspect of formal and informal education ndash schoolroom teacher hot meal etc ndash could serve as the basis for real social mobility which Arbel say be ldquoone of the most significant tool in our national resiliencerdquothe war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in antisemitism worldwide since October have lead to increase interest by Diaspora Jews in move to Israel another notable initiative that Arbel mention be create an ldquoaliyah eligibility documentrdquo what happen Arbel explain be that potential olim sometimes express interest in move to Israel but do not follow through with the process such that if they want to renew it later on they will have to start afresh instead Arbel propose enable these family to complete all of the necessary paperwork without actually make the move ndash and thus enable they to make aliyah immediately in the future if they wisharbel prefer not to express his view on the situation in Gaza and the public debate about how much Israel should concede in a hostage deal but perhaps more important than his work in the Interior Ministry and his support of haredi enlistment be his sympathy for the family of the hostagesHe say he be concern by criticism that minister have not meet enough with the family of hostage since the war break out and say that he meet at least once a week with a family the meeting be difficult and the family be experience immense pain and anger but as a government minister Arbel

jp_118,gaza border community struggle to recover six month after evacuation North of the Gaza Strip the surf be pound the beach south of Ashkelon one of these beach be know as Zikim and it share a name with a kibbutz on a hill above itthis be a beautiful area there be a small pond and stream near the beach and dune with small stout layer of brush stretch up from the waterfront toward the east the dune form a kind of frame to the area set off the kibbutz and a road that run down to the sea from an industrial area of AshkelonToday this area be desert the beach which once host the toned body of young man and woman from the area who come to enjoy the spot and the fisherman who would come on weekend to try their hand at a catch be go it be all go because Hamas attack this beach on October when it invade two dozen point along the border with Israel and carry out its massacreI come to this area on October try to reach the coastal area because there be several IDF post here I think that with the war unfold it might be a good place to find a story at the time I didnrsquot know there be still fight go on in this area and terrorist be lurk in the bush and dunesI learn the area be an active combat zone when I come upon the body of two terrorist and a stillrunne Savannah van park next to they on October near the fence that run around Kibbutz Zikim the fighting here continue for daysOn October several soldier from the Maglan special unit be kill in this area flag with their name be now drape on a concrete shelter along the road inside their comrade have write their name and leave candle and a kippah in their memorysix month laterIT have be six month since that day October be the second day of the war six month later I be in Kibbutz Zikim look out onto the road where I have encounter the dead terrorist and the van A member of the community recall the same scene unfold on October from inside ZikimAlthough terrorist be able to attack and infiltrate the IDF post near the border kill soldier and massacre civilian on Zikim Beach the kibbutz itself be save by the quick response of its emergency response team and soldierstoday the kibbutz seem like it be slowly return to life and some of the resident have return the community be lay out in a large circle with house face the perimeter fence look toward the sea Itrsquos bucolic and beautiful it be also fill with peacock for some reason the bird apparently escape from a local small zoo and have infest the community for year because there be so few human resident the animal seem to have the run of the placeI spend October and travel along the border with Gaza see community that face the brunt of the attack on October and also see those that be save from the massacre each community have a story ndash story of tragedy bravery and sometimes good luck that keep people safeSix month after the war begin itrsquo important to recall that these community be still evacuate their resident scatter around Israel in many case the community try to stick together but they face an uncertain futureon the afternoon of October the IDF say it have evacuate Bersquoeri Nahal Oz Netiv Harsquoasara and Zikim while Zikim have be save from the massacre nearby Netiv Harsquoasara which be directly on the border with Gaza be breach and the terrorist murder numerous member of the community the terrorist also carry out massacre at Bersquoeri and Nahal OzNahal Oz be one of the hard communityrsquo to reach today because it be close to the border and there be an IDF checkpoint on the road lead to it all of these community now have soldier at their front gate and permission be require to enternahal oz be a unique case to get to it the road snake down by the border several year ago a large concrete wall be erect to shield the road from Gaza and the wall be then paint with pastoral scene and a giant mural indicate that the community be celebrate year since its founding unlike Zikim there be a sense it will take time before anyone can return to this areaOn October the IDF also evacuate Nir be Mefalsim Kfar Aza Gevim or Haner Ivim Yad Mordechai Karmiya Kerem Shalom Kissufim Holit Sufa Nirim Nir Oz Ein Hashlosha Nir Yitzhak Magen Rersquoim Sarsquoad and AlumimToday these community have the same struggle that Zikim and Nahal Oz face their resident be live in different part of Israel and it be not clear when service will be available for people to return to or if people will feel secure enough to returnin some community people return only for a few hour a day or several day a week they might have job nearby or they come to tend a garden or to do some kind of other work for the community in the community dining hall where there once would have be crowd or laughter or plan for community event there be often silence or only a few people huddle to eatitrsquos hard to make sense of this on the one hand the war in Gaza feel like it be wind down at the high point in Zikim for instance there be an old home build in by an Arab notable who have a citrus grove near here from the roof of the old stately home where sandbag be pile probably from the early day of the war one can see into Gaza Smoke rise and there be a rattat of machinegun fire but the sound of artillery and explosion be no long commonfurther down the border this be not always the case near the site of the Supernova music festival massacre the sound of artillery be present everywhere along the border the buzzing of drone be clear but the heavy military presence of the first month of the war be goneitrsquos not normal because normal would mean the civilian resident have return Itrsquos abnormal but itrsquo also not war because much of the war seem to have pause like a country take a deep breath and then wonder what to do nextwhat come next at Kibbutz Sufa for instance it sit near the border and feel forlorn at nearby Nir Yitzhak there be square hay bale stack in small mountain in warehouse clearly the agricultural work have go on at a fever pitchIn fact thatrsquos another contrast on the border work go on everywhere in the field in some case it be do by foreign worker who can be see ride motorize bike to their work Small Thailand flag flutter from the bikesin one field a giant machine with long metal arm like a massive mechanical bug in some kind of future apocalyptic movie amble along water the field it wasnrsquot even clear if there be a person on the machine bring a sense that the future here hang in the balance between civilian return and machine take overthis be not what the kibbutz pioneer of the late and have in mind when these community be found they live in tent and farm they take their boltaction rifle and later automatic to the field with they they dance and sing and play sport they serve in elite unit they grow oldtheir descendant want to return but so far it be mostly the old people who express steadfastness and confidence those with child who be abandon for many hour on October and have to leave on October face an uncertain future how can they return and trust the state again to protect themthe state hasnrsquot return the hostage hold in Gaza Therersquos also a sense the government have abandon these community that there be lack of care for they and that there be no government here they be fend for themselves like in the era of the british MandateThese community be once the heart of the statersquos endeavor to carve out the border of Israel but now they feel like they have become the ultimate peripherynbsp

minimize the dispute with a well handling of the issue that cause we problem and with the initiation of more proactive policiesrdquo he statedthree error Israel should correct in gazasarsquoar FOCUSED on three error Israel should correct in Gaza now that the war spark by Hamasrsquos invasion of Israel on October will soon hit the halfyear markThe first he say he put on the table already in October he call for the ldquosurrender and exile of the Hamas military wing and the palestinian Islamic Jihad from Gaza to country friendly to they Syria Turkey Qatar and IranrdquoThe hostage would be free in conjunction and the deal could also include an israeli agreement to release some palestinian security prisoner and terrorist he saidthe framing of the idea he say should be that it be Israelrsquos ceasefire proposal rather than perpetually be in the position of appear to object to a halt to the warit also work as an answer to the international objection to israelrsquos pende military operation in Rafah to destroy the remain Hamas battalionsthe ldquoargument against it would be that Hamas wonrsquot agree to it that be probably correctrdquo he say ldquoat least not at this momentldquoBut at least we can tell the world and say lsquoWe want to enter Rafah but we do not have torsquo if this Hamas surrender and exile plan happen then we can end the war you say you want a ceasefire you want to end Hamasrsquos governance of Gaza well here be a pragmatic idea that also end the humanitarian suffering cause by the warrdquo he statedthis framing help put the onus on Hamas for the failure to achieve a ceasefire he explainedldquoit give we more legitimization with our friend and then if there be no other optionsrdquo Israel can explain that it have to finish the war because Hamas wonrsquot agree to end it Sarsquoar saidhis second issue deal with the failure around the delivery of humanitarian assistance for which Israel do not provide option effectively and quickly enoughsarsquoar speak amid a bitter dispute between Israel and the international community on the issue of humanitarian assistance with the United Nations and the European Union accuse Israel of create starvation condition in GazaIsrael have say that more than enough aid enter Gaza but that the UN and international organization have fail to properly distribute itthe army should have seize control of the situation from the start and create a humanitarian administration to ensure the distribution of food and the provision of water and basic sanitation Sarsquoar saidThe international community would still provide the aid and be involve but the army would have oversight to make sure that delivery be successfulldquoI know the army doesnrsquot love thisrdquo Sarsquoar say acknowledge that there be some risk with the plan which could lead to increase friction between the IDF and palestinian civilian in GazaItrsquos a plan that also tackle some of the governance vacuum create by the IDFrsquos military campaign against Hamas which partially but not completely eliminate the terrorist grouprsquo force rule of the enclaveuntil Hamas be destroy there canrsquot be an alternative government in Gaza Sarsquoar say add that IDF control of the distribution of basic service in partnership with international organization be the only smart option that can prevent the terrorist grouprsquo returnif the IDF have take charge of issue of food water medicine and sanitation Israel would have a well ldquostanding in the international communityrdquo Sarsquoar stressedHis third point Sarsquoar say be that the war have to proceed at a quick pace for the sake of israelrsquos economy its international standing and the loom threat of an allout war with Hezbollah in the northldquoWe have always know that we need to wage the war as quickly as possiblerdquo he say ldquoIt be hard for we to wage longterm warsrdquosome think that the international community would lose interest in the war as time go on Sarsquoar explain add that he always believe Israel have a tight timeline for the warldquoIt be clear from the start that this idea be mistaken we canrsquot drag on the war foreverrdquo he saidldquoa long as you havenrsquot end the Gaza war you canrsquot deal with Hezbollahrdquo he addedHezbollah have to withdraw from the border he say as he reference diplomatic effort to ensure that it comply with Resolution which set out the ceasefire term that end the Second Lebanon War in then can the resident in community along that border who be evacuate at the start of the Gaza war when violence break out simultaneously with Lebanon return homeIn the end they will return home ldquoIt have to happenrdquo Sarsquoar stress but that he hope Israel will do it through diplomacy and not through a fullscale warSaar a palestinian state be a danger to israelsarsquoar who begin his political life in the Likud in and form his own party initially call New Hope in do not disagree with all of Netanyahursquos policiesHe have always be oppose to the creation of a palestinian state even more so now in the aftermath of October palestinian state be a danger to Israel to its security and it be not a lsquomaybersquo danger itrsquo a clear danger the creation of a palestinian state would allow they to continue their war to destroy Israel from an improve positionrdquo it would ldquostrengthen those palestinian force who believe that war bring resultsrdquoIsrael have to work to prevent palestinian statehood he say it can take a positive stance on other issue regard the Palestinians but it canrsquot allow itself to go in this directionshould the Palestinian Authority be reform such that it stop its monthly payment to terrorist jail by Israel and the incitement in its education system then it could be possible to advance in certain area he saidsarsquoar say he stand with Netanyahu in oppose the return of the PA to Gaza he have also support many of the stance Netanyahu have take in the international arena include in his relationship with the United StatesldquoNetanyahu be act to preserve Israelrsquos international interest in this war and in most of the situation when he fight with the US I think he be rightrdquo Sarsquoar explainedldquohistorically prime minister have be at odd with supportive US president during a warrdquo Sarsquoar say as he recall the diplomatic battle between former prime minister Menachem Begin and former US president Ronald Reagan during the First Lebanon WarHe point to the most recent battle between Jerusalem and Washington over the Biden

get Israel into trouble with many country by portray it as the ldquoaggressorrdquoOn the other hand what happen at alaqsa Mosque compound Temple Mount have embolden his rival in Hamas and other extremist group show that they have more influence and support in Jerusalem than the PA or JordanThe violence that erupt at the Temple Mount last Friday bring the israelipalestinian conflict back to the center of the worldrsquos attention which have be almost entirely focused on the russian invasion of Ukraine since February this come as good news for AbbasSince the Ukraine war begin palestinian official in Ramallah have be work hard to redirect the international communityrsquos attention toward the israelipalestinian conflict their major concern be that Israel would exploit the worldrsquos preoccupation with the war to impose new fact on the ground especially in Jerusalem and its islamic holy site but in the past week these official have express satisfaction with the wide coverage the violence in Jerusalem receive in the international mediaAbbas and his aide be even more delighted to see the large number of condemnation of Israel in particular those come from arab and Islamic countriesUS Secretary of State Antony Blinkenrsquos phone call to his jordanian counterpart during which he ldquoemphasize the importance of uphold the historic status quo at the Haram alshariftemple Mountrdquo be also receive with deep satisfaction in Ramallah and Amman Abbas be also happy to receive a phone call from Blinken with a similar messageever since the resumption of jewish visit to the Temple Mount several year ago the PA leadership have be accuse Israel of wage ldquoreligious warrdquo on the MuslimsThe accusation which continue to this day aim to rally as many Arabs and Muslims as possible against Israel the visit of the Jews be portray by palestinian and jordanian official and media outlet as violent incursion by extremist settler under the protection of the Israel PoliceYet the allegation fail to achieve their goal as the reaction of most Arabs and Muslims have remain limited to lip servicescene of Palestinians burn flag and photo of arab leader engage in normalization with Israel manage to enrage many Arabs especially those reside in the Gulf state those Arabs be far enrage when they see Palestinians curse and harass Emirati and bahraini visitor to the Temple MountThe Abraham Accords which be sign between Israel and a number of arab country as well as the apparent rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia leave the Palestinians with the impression that the Arabs and Muslims do not really care about Israelrsquos ostensible scheme to change the status quo at the Temple Mount by allocate time and space for jewish prayer therethatrsquo why palestinian official in Ramallah be please this week to see the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Saudi Arabia condemn ldquothe Israel Policersquos storming of alaqsa Mosquerdquo these official however be aware that the UAE and Bahrain be not go to take drastic measure such as recall their ambassador from IsraelBy contrast the PA leadership appear to be content with the crisis that erupt this week between Israel and Jordan in the aftermath of the violence at the Temple MountSince the beginning of the tension at the holy site the PA and Jordan have be hold intensive discussion on ldquodefendingrdquo alaqsa Mosque and ldquothwartingrdquo Israelrsquos allege attempt to alter the status quo the feeling in Ramallah be that the Jordanians be the only one who be side with the PalestiniansldquoThe State of Palestine commend the courageous jordanian stance express by King Abdullah of Jordan and the jordanian government parliament and people in defend Jerusalem and the christian and islamic holy sitesrdquo the PA say in a statement issue by its foreign ministry ldquoThe State of Palestine and its people highly appreciate the diplomatic activity lead by King Abdullah to expose the israeli aggression on alaqsa MosquerdquoTHE PA and Jordan nonetheless have good reason to be worried about the event of the past week the violence that erupt at the Temple Mount have show that Ramallah and Amman have little influence if any over the young man and woman who clash with the israeli security forcesthe Jordaniancontrolled Wakf islamic religious trust which be responsible for administer the islamic holy site in Jerusalem fail to stop dozen of rioter from enter the mosque with stone and firework the Wakf have dozen of security guard station at the Temple Mount but they do not intervene to stop the rioter and thug from sneak into the mosquesimilarly the pa which have its own supporter and representative at the Temple Mount do not do anything to stop the rioter from storm into alaqsa Mosque with a large cache of stone and other objectson the eve of Ramadan some israeli and US official approach the PA and Jordan and ask they to work toward prevent an outbreak of violence in Jerusalem particularly the Temple MountBut instead of appeal for calm Ramallah and Amman ramp up their rhetorical attack on Israel warn that allow Jews to enter the Temple Mount would ignite ldquoreligious warrdquo and plunge the entire region into a fresh cycle of violencethe PA and Jordan do not feel comfortable admit that supporter of Hamas and other extremist group be the one who call the shot at the Temple Mount Itrsquos easier for Ramallah and Amman to hold Israel solely responsible for the violence than denounce the rioter who desecrate alaqsa Mosque in fact the PA and Jordan seem to have score a diplomatic and propaganda achievement by convince many in the international community that it be Israel that plan and initiate the violencewhile the violence seem to have serve abbasrsquos goal of shift the blame toward Israel he nevertheless appear worried that he be exclude from the first stage of the mediation effort to restore calmInstead of talk to Abbas the Egyptians Qataris and the United Nations choose to negotiate with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh who be base in QatarAccording to palestinian source Abbas be ldquofuriousrdquo for be sideline by the mediator mainly because this allow Hamas to score more point with the palestinian public and gain more legitimacy in the international arenaabdullah for his part be worried that the violence at the Temple Mount and the rise tension with Israel could cost the Hashemites their status as custodian of the islamic and christian holy site in Jerusalem he be well aware that palestinian teenager hurl stone at israeli police officer have more influence than his Wakf in Jerusalem but that do not mean that the monarch be prepared to walk away from the cityIn recent year report have surface that Israel may allow Saudi Arabia and other arab and islamic country to replace the Hashemites as the sole custodian of the holy site the report be say to have anger Abdullah who have since be make a huge effort to reassert the royal familyrsquos role in tend the islamic and christian holy site in Jerusalem he do not seem to be worry if Hamas present itself as the ldquodefenderrdquo of Jerusalem as long as that do not affect the Hashemitesrsquo status as ldquocustodiansrdquo of the holy siteslike Abbas Abdullah be also worried about the increase role Hamas and other islamist group be play at the Temple MountVideos and photo feature rioter wrap in Hamas flag and chant slogan in support of Hamas archterrorist Mohammed Deif over the past week have undoubtedly leave Abdullah perturb still he do not seem to be worry if Hamas present itself as the ldquodefenderrdquo of Jerusalem as long as that do not affect the Hashemitesrsquo status as ldquocustodiansrdquo of the holy sitesIn Ramallah PA official be also unhappy to see the Hamas supporter lead the riotstherersquos no doubt that the inflammatory statement that come from Ramallah and Amman before and during the event of the past week serve the interest of Hamas and other extremist in orchestrate the riot at the Temple MountAbbas and Abdullah would have be happy to see the rioter raise their photo instead they get Hamas banner and flag and be force to watch and hear Palestinians call on the Gazabased terrorist group to fire rocket at IsraelNow it appear that Abbas and Abdullah be desperately try to extinguish the very fire they helped ignite not out of concern for Israelrsquos security but out of fear of be totally remove from the holy siteBut because they donrsquot dare to speak out against the young man and woman who have turn alaqsa Mosque into a battlefield and spoil the Ramadan celebration and prayer for hundred of thousand of muslim worshipper the current strategy of the PA and Jordan be to get the international community to exert pressure on Israel to halt jewish ldquoprovocationsrdquoeven if the situation do calm down after Ramadan end as expect itrsquos evident that the status quo have indeed shift at the Temple MountBut itrsquo not Israel that have change the status quo rather itrsquo the shabab youth and Hamas who have manage to create a new reality in which they be now the ldquocustodiansrdquo and ldquodefendersrdquo of alaqsa Mosquebull

DDRampD and the israeli defense industry while the first visit start with marked skepticism surround the feasibility of develop the system it end with admiration for the system but with expectation that the project would not be complete on time or within budget yet one year later during a subsequent visit the delegation be enthral by the pace of Iron Domersquos development and advancement in

and subsequently approve by Keren Buchris and Barak they be then present to relevant american stakeholder and result in thenpresident Barack Obama allocate million in special assistance to the program a central element of the committeersquos proposal insist that assistance be limit to equip the Iron Dome system in an effort to prevent any future potential export restriction on the system and ensure development remain ldquoblue and whiterdquo in its entirety nbsp in the decade follow that decision the US significantly increase its financial contribution to equip additional Iron Dome system and

allocate million annually to ballistic missile defense with the equipping of Iron Dome component be an important component thereof nbsp the past decade ndash analysis and lesson learn nbsp today the Iron Dome missile defense system be highly regard in professional political military and civilian circle both in Israel and abroad and have receive numerous prize and praise for its groundbreaking military innovation and success in save life the term ldquoiron Domerdquo have become ingrain in the hebrew lexicon synonymous with incredible success nbsp despite its operational and technological success those initial naysayer be not quick to mute themselves or their criticism at the tactical level Iron Domersquos operational capability be call into question while at the strategic level concern be raise that the damage outweigh any benefit especially give the negative impact on the nationallevel decisionmake process and international legitimization nbsp they claim that Iron Dome with the passage of time have become a burden rather than an asset and a doubleedge sword an academic research project conduct at the National Security College guide by one of the author of this article analyze Iron Domersquos impact on the israeli National Security Strategy ndash economically militarily socially and politically after a decade of operational experience and more than successful interception the research conclusively find that the Iron Dome system be a firstclass asset and clear barrier breaker not remotely resemble a doubleedged sword Iron Dome often change the decisionmake process of israelrsquos political echelon and our enemiesrsquo method and tactic nbsp Iron Dome be a key element of Israelrsquos multilayere defense array develop to protect the home front from incoming missile threat while Iron Dome protect against shortrange threat the davidrsquos Sling system defend against midtier threat and the Arrow system defend against uppertier threat nbsp the US Army face many threat similar to Israel decide to procure two Iron Dome battery as an interim solution while decide what the most appropriate endure solution would be for its need simultaneously the US Marines also express interest in the system and have conduct several successful test in America nbsp the continued collaboration between Israel and the US in the development and equipping of Iron Dome contribute to strengthen the strategic and technological collaboration between the two country and their defense of their respective civilian and service member nbsp nbsp as we celebrate year since Iron Domersquos first interception we be remind of the importance of recall the overall goal that lead decisionmaker to develop this system bull Life and limb Save live above all else almost at any cost bull strategic asset protect strategic facility military facility and national infrastructure bull economic defense reduce the amount of direct and indirect economic damage cost of property human casualty and injury and prevent interference with the economy and national gross productionnbsp bull strategic flexibility provide additional option to political decisionmaker by reduce the risk pose by incoming rocket bull Ability to act increase the militaryrsquos freedom to act via the ability to carry out offensive operation free from the fear of retaliatory rocket attack bull Confidence Raise the national morale and spirit decrease the psychological impact on the population cause by image of damage and destruction especially in the age of social medium nbsp indepth ANALYSIS of relevant event of the past decade lead to determination of success on several level such as bull Economic perspective a review of the past decadersquos economic datum prove beyond all doubt that Iron Dome certainly stand up to the economic test this be far support with the realization that the comparison can not be between the cost of the interceptor and the cost of a missile but rather the total cost of a launch compare to the direct and indirect economic consequence result from incoming enemy missile score direct hit bull Societal Perspective Iron Dome as an effective defense system significantly contribute to israelrsquos sense of community and national pride it contribute to Israelrsquos degree of resilience by reduce overall level of fear and anxiety create a unified home front with all its civilian feeling protect in the battle over public opinion the system also contribute to Israelrsquos story of success over the enemy and improve overall morale both during and after period of combat however it be also important to note that the systemrsquo past success create a danger of an illusion of security to civilian to prevent such negative surprise it be essential that our leader set reasonable expectation for citizen Outlook for the next decade nbsp over the past decade Iron Dome provide unprecedented superiority during the next decade we can expect enemy will respond with technological effort of their own all sign suggest they have already start and thus there be no time to waste testing improvement and adaptation of Iron Dome be constantly require as a way to ensure it maintain its legendary superiority this be an endless battle in the fight between the threat and the interceptornbsp nbsp without get into specific it be clear that every system have limitation and vulnerability however if we do not put forth every effort to further its innovation and renewal our adversary will detract from Iron Domersquos effectiveness and superiority there be no indefinitely hermetic defensive solutionnbsp nbsp we can not rest on our laurel we must consistently test the enemiesrsquo advancement and threat trend and adapt our system to achieve optimal effective defense in order to maintain relevance on the future battlefield nbsp nbsp one KEY area of interest be laserbase solution nbsp during the Iron Dome decisionmaking process and continuously ever since baseless allegation have be make related to the performance of laserbase system versus kinetic interceptionbased system use missile nbsp each solution have advantage and disadvantage that be important to raise and understand understand the pro and con of a laserbase system be especially important today give the great progress recently make in Israel in technology development nbsp it be critical to correct some of the factually incorrect argument in favor of transition to a laserbase system bull ldquoA laserbase interception system will prevent disruption to daily life as it be an almost perfect and hermetic systemrdquo Hermetic system do not exist and it be clear that with any system daily routine will be disrupt in any case the performance of the missilebase system seem to be well than those base on laser bull ldquolaser system will well handle barrage attacksrdquo actually the opposite be true and this be one of the most compelling disadvantage to a laserbased system since such a systemrsquos primary role would be to handle a series of threat statement allege ldquointerception at the speed of lightrdquo be mislead while the beam can reach its target at the speed of light and notably fast than a missile it must remain on each target for several second to destroy it how long can not be reveal and largely depend on the threat variant the strength of the beam and its distance from the target the laserbased system would be quite limited in its ability to counter attack salvos unless it could be build with multiple beam mean another system which would substantially increase the overall cost in multipurpose missilebase system the missile be launch independently be operate simultaneously by the system and operate instantaneously on the target to counter incoming threat bull ldquolaser system donrsquot require adaptation for new threatsrdquo Laserbased system be not robust and each threat need to be program for separately nbsp ON FEBRUARY the Defense Ministry announce a groundbreaking technological achievement in the development of the solidstate laser the depth and gravity of this achievement be noteworthy as be its potential for strengthen Israelrsquos low tactical defensive layer capabilitie the correct and planned use of this new technology add to the interception capability in a new cheap way base on an understanding of its limitationsnbsp nbsp while this be a major advancement that allow for a demonstration of the systemrsquos battlefield capabilitie the full operational range of the system be still several year and hundred of million of shekel of development away there be no doubt that the addition of a laser interceptor alongside the classic Iron Dome interceptor will improve overall performance and will also be beneficial to israelrsquos partner include the US nbsp in SUMMARY after a decade of operational work of the Iron Dome system it can be say that we must tip our hat to all those who have work on this project over the past year the decisionmake stage development of the system its integration and its transition into successful operationalization and use through continuous improvement along the way nbsp that be say Iron Dome be not yet complete and it will likely continue for many year to come our enemy be learn the system all the time and without question they never cease to try to surprise we the role of all those involve be to always be one step ahead of they BrigGennbsp resnbsp Profnbsp Jacobnbsp Nagelnbsp isnbsp anbsp seniornbsp fellownbsp atnbsp thenbsp Foundationnbsp fornbsp

jp_209,why be pa rhetoric so antiisrael when there be good cooperation two separate incident that take place in the West Bank over the past few day underline the discrepancy between the palestinian Authorityrsquos rhetoric in public and its action on the ground ldquoThe Palestinian Authority be a real Jekyll and Hyderdquo a ramallahbase western diplomat remark this week with reference to the inconsistency ldquoThe palestinian Authorityrsquos rhetoric towards Israel be bad but its action on the ground especially the security coordination with the israeli security authority be goodrdquo the diplomatrsquos remark be share by many Palestinians who be familiar with the inner working of the PA in the first incident two israeli woman in their be spot by Palestinians late at night drive their car alone inside alamarsquori refugee camp at the entrance to Ramallah and its twin city ElBireh the camp be consider a stronghold of palestinian militant belong to various group include those oppose to PA President Mahmoud Abbas and his rule Fatah faction the PA security force be often reluctant to enter alAmarsquori to avoid friction with the group in this case however as soon as the PA security force be inform about the presence of the israeli woman in the camp they rush to the scene and safely escort they out and hand they over to the idf the second incident take place in the PAcontrolled part of Hebron a city traditionally know as a stronghold of islamist group particularly Hamas and Hizb utTahrir Party of Liberation a bus carry IDF soldier that accidentally enter Hebron be safely escort by PA security force out of the city no one be hurt and minimal damage be cause to the bus as a result of rockthrowe by a small number of Palestinians the two incident could have end in a tragic way be it not for the intervention of the PA security force have any of the woman or soldier be harm this would have result in a serious deterioration in the security situation on the ground and renew tension between the new israeli government head by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the PA such an escalation would also have deal a severe blow to the Biden administrationrsquo effort to rebuild confidence between Israel and the Palestinians with the hope of revive the stall peace process the Biden administration have endorse a policy that seek to bolster the standing of the PA as a way of counter the rise popularity of Hamas the Americans want the israeli government to follow suit by engage with PA official and refrain from unilateral move include the eviction of arab family from their home in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah Indeed Bennettrsquos government and the PA leadership appear to be move toward some form of rapprochement in addition to the continue security coordination israeli and PA minister recently meet for the first time in several year moreover the government have agree to increase the number of permit for Palestinians who wish to work in Israel and accord to palestinian source senior PA official whose vip card be confiscate by the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu have get they back some Palestinians maintain that the security coordination between the PA security force and the IDF never stop not even when Abbas and other palestinian institution claim that they have suspend all tie with Israel include in the security field the incident in Ramallah and Hebron be not the first of their kind several case involve israeli jewish citizen who be see by the Palestinians inside Area A of the West Bank have be return safely to Israel thank to the effort of the PA security force Entry into this area which be control exclusively by the PA be forbid to all israeli citizen Israel however do not stop ArabIsraelis from enter Area a Most of the case involve Israelis catch in Area A be not publicize probably in order to avoid embarrass the PA each time Palestinians learn that the PA security force ldquorescuedrdquo israeli citizen catch in Area A they accuse the palestinian leadership of ldquocollaborationrdquo and serve as ldquosubcontractorsrdquo for the israeli security establishment but the security coordination be not a oneway relationship benefit Israel alone Abbas be quote a few year ago as tell a group of Israelis who visit he at the Mukata presidential compound in Ramallah that security coordination with Israel be ldquosacredrdquo although Abbas do not elaborate itrsquo obvious that the Palestinians too enjoy the fruit of this coordination First the PA and Israel have a common enemy in the West Bank ndash Hamas Abbas be well aware that without israelrsquos security presence in the West Bank Hamas and another iranianbacked proxy palestinian Islamic Jihad would pose a direct threat to the PA Second the security coordination ensure the continue flow of fund to the PA from the Americans Europeans and other international party in a bid to far curry favor with the western donor include the Biden administration Abbas and senior PA official have recently indicate their readiness to return to the negotiating table with Israel under the auspex of the Quartet member ndash US European Union United Nations and Russia PA official who be talk about their dissatisfaction with the Bennett government be actually send a message to the Biden administration that it need to get more involved in the israelipalestinian conflict yet while palestinian security officer be ldquorescuingrdquo Israelis who accidentally enter Area A and as the security coordination appear to be continue in full force and effect the rhetoric of the PA and Fatah toward Israel remain as toxic as ever this be precisely why many Palestinians and Israelis be confused about the real intention of the PA leadership on the one hand the PA be tell Palestinians that it want to prosecute Israelis for ldquowar crimesrdquo and ldquoethnic cleansingrdquo before international forum include the International Criminal Court the PA be also tell Palestinians that there be no difference between the Bennett government and the Netanyahu government especially regard the policy of settlement construction and the ldquojudaizationrdquo of Jerusalem on the other hand this be the same pa that be allow its minister and security official to hold meeting with their israeli counterpart similarly many in Israel still can not figure out whether the PA be an ally or an enemy the PArsquos deed and rhetoric suggest that it be both an ally and an enemy it be an ally when it come to work with the IDF in maintain security and stability in the West Bank it be an enemy when it come to the fiery rhetoric of PA official and medium outlet ldquoThe Palestinian Authority have always excel in send conflicting message to both the Palestinians and the Israelisrdquo remark a veteran palestinian journalist from Ramallah ldquoThe Palestinians have long become used to the duplicity of the palestinian leadershiprdquo the PArsquos action on the ground may be good for Israel in the short term these action place the PA on the side of the good guy in the war on terrorism in the long run however the antiIsrael rhetoric emerge from Ramallah be far radicalize Palestinians the PA in other word be drive more Palestinians into the welcome arm of its own rival Hamas and palestinian Islamic Jihad the apparent rapprochement between the PA and the israeli government and the Biden administrationrsquo policy of ldquostrengtheningrdquo the PA be critical for the continued survival of Abbas and his cohort but this approach come with a cost the close Abbas move toward Israel and the US the more he lose point with the palestinian street the Bennett government and the Biden administration may help the Abbas hold on to power but therersquo nothing the Israelis and Americans can do to help he regain the confidence of his people abbasrsquos decision to cancel the parliamentary election which be suppose to take place on May and the recent unprecedented massive security crackdown on palestinian political activist journalist and social medium user have severely undermine the credibility of the PA leadership at this stage itrsquo clear that the widespread discontent with the Ramallahbased leadership do not pose an imminent threat to the PA the PA security force remain loyal to Abbas and the number of people willing to take to the street to demand ldquoregime changerdquo be decline every week if and when the peace talk with Israel resume Abbas be sure to face a radical reaction from the Palestinians under the current circumstance the likelihood of market any agreement with Israel to the palestinian public be zero this statistical nonstarter be the direct result of the PArsquos decadeslong demonization of Israel which remain one of the major obstacle to move forward with any peace process

lead to another major confrontation with Israel the Biden administration have revive the talk about a twostate solution as the only way to resolve the conflict and state its opposition to any step by either side that risk spark violence or undermine the prospect for return to the pursuit of two state additionally the Biden administration have be say it believe Palestinians and Israelis ldquodeserve equal measure of security freedom opportunity and dignityrdquo this rhetoric in addition to the resumption of US financial aid to the Palestinians obviously contribute to Abbasrsquos decision to again turn his back on Hamas the israeli governmentrsquo decision to resume highlevel contact with the PA leadership be also see by some Palestinians as another reason behind Abbas steer clear of Hamas Abbas know that he stand to gain more by align himself with the US and Israel than make peace with Hamas some of whose leader have never miss an opportunity to denounce he as a ldquotraitorrdquo and ldquocollaboratorrdquo with the enemy of the Palestinians for Abbas an alliance with the US and Israel be tantamount to an insurance policy for the survival of the PA he also know that such an alliance do not come without a price make he less popular among the Palestinians on the other hand Abbas be well aware that make peace with Hamas would only spell trouble he be not in a rush to return to the Gaza Strip and pay salary to ten of thousand of Palestinians he know that even if he return to the coastal enclave he and his security force will never be able to disarm the various terrorist group or prevent they from launch rocket and incendiary balloon into Israel Abbas also know that any deal he strike with Hamas will jeopardize his relation not only with Israel but with the US and the European Union too when palestinian businessman Munib alMasri lately ask Abbas about his condition for incorporate Hamas into a palestinian unity government the PA leader tell he that the group must first accept all international resolution pertain to the IsraeliArab conflict Abbas in other word demand that Hamas recognize Israelrsquos right to exist Hamas be quick to reject the demand accuse Abbas of act on behalf of the US and Israel to ldquoblackmailrdquo the group into abandon its ideology and principle ldquohamas be not serious about end the conflict with Fatahrdquo say a senior palestinian official ldquohama want to continue rule the Gaza Strip with the hope of turn it into an islamic emirate Hamas be serve the agenda of foreign power include Iran and Qatar who want to see the Palestinians divide foreverrdquo in many way it be safe to assume that Abbas be comfortable with the status quo which absolve he of responsibility for what happen in the Gaza Strip the security coordination between the PA security force and the IDF also serve as an insurance policy for the survival of the palestinian leadership in Ramallah Abbas know that as long as Israel maintain a security presence in the West Bank Hamas will never succeed in extend its control beyond the Gaza Strip the current strategy of the PA be to strengthen its relation with the US administration with the hope that such a move would ensure the continue flow of financial aid to the Palestinians and despite its public criticism of Israel the PA leadership seem to be relatively satisfied with the new and less hostile approach of the israeli government the close Abbas move toward the US and Israel the far he move away from Hamas this leave Hamas with one option enhance its tie with Iran Qatar and Turkey as a way of tighten its grip on the Gaza Strip the split between the West Bank and Gaza Strip long regard by many Palestinians as a fait accompli be likely to continue even in the postAbbas era because most of the official surround he be not know as fan of reconciliation with Hamas

symbolic number serve in the IDFThis would not truly address all of the IDF service inequality that have anger the public for decade but it would at least show the majority of the population that the haredim be ready to contribute to the national destiny in a physical and quantifiable way Haredim claim they care for the spiritual sustenance of the nationalso if more Israelis from other sector be be pull out of necessary job the haredim step in with national service would cover some of that gapAdvocates of the Gantz compromise say it would temper some economic impact and start a social

agree with Allon on demography and Zionism he reject annexation even as prime minister a decade later Beginrsquos alternative be autonomy for the ldquoarab population in the Land of Israelrdquo include control of education finance service and other sector ndash everything except security and foreign policyneither Allonrsquos nor Beginrsquos proposal go beyond the debating stage primarily because the Palestinians be only interested in turn the clock back to ndash in other word the elimination of Israel nothing cause they to abandon the ldquoallornothingrdquo approach and consider pragmatic compromise such as a ldquotwostate solutionrdquo or a federation with JordanIN the POLICY vacuum the israeli presence in these area gradually and chaotically increase periodically another attempt at change would start ndash for example in thenforeign minister Shimon Peres negotiate secretly with Jordanrsquos King Hussein in London ndash but this be another dead endthe Oslo Accords sign

present as embody the ldquoland for peacerdquo formula lead to a permanent status agreement and presumably two state within five year the term ldquoend of conflictrdquo be use frequently and the demographic threat to Zionism seem to be avertedBut to Palestinians PLO leader Yasser Arafat market Oslo as a shortterm tactical measure to be renounce once the benefit have be realize the massive UNRWA ldquorefugeerdquo support system remain intact and the incitement and terrorist attack continue and even increase in the form of mass terror direct or at least approve of by Arafat Israelis recognize that on the other side nothing have change and Israelrsquos improve relation with the socalled ldquointernational communityrdquo evaporate quickly when the IDF move to counter Arafatrsquos warthe next effort to end the stalemate take place in when prime minister Ariel Sharon unilaterally ldquodisengagedrdquo from Gaza and from two small civilian location ldquosettlementsrdquo in Samaria two year later the Hamas terrorist organization take control of Gaza follow by the acquisition of thousand of rocket and missile and the construction of massive terror tunnel Sharon become incapacitated in Israel fail to destroy the nascent Hamas war machine and discussion of further unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank come to a halt particularly with the election of Benjamin Netanyahu in Netanyahu also understand the difficulty inherent in an infinite stalemate lead he to support the initiative for unilateral annexation ldquoextension of sovereigntyrdquo Details be not reveal and no official map be make public but the discourse focus on incorporate the major settlement and the strategic area of Area C include the Jordan Valley however the effort became mire in israeli electoral politic as well as strong international opposition and in it be officially halt in the context of the Abraham AccordsAs this brief history demonstrate after year the temporary status quo with all of its weakness continue at the same time the default option of a single political entity between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River with roughly equal population and the implication for Zionism also remain ndash and as note be the Palestinianrsquos favorite these problem will not disappear and as Israelis we have the obligation of continue to look for well optionsA Strategy of Political RealismWith this dismal history it be not surprising that many Israelis have give up the long drift and its implication be not include in the election platform of any of the main party and that be precisely the problem it play into those who be not exactly supporter of Zionism and see the evolution of a onestate framework as the good path to their objectivesTo move forward by learn from the failure a new strategy be long overdue anchor in political realism and concrete israeli interest as distinct from hope faith or ideology Realism require the careful analysis of the relative potential cost and benefit of different option include continue the status quo base on security military capability defensible border Zionism and demography a viable jewish majority and the perception of Israel from the outside public diplomacy and imageon this basis and unlike Oslo and the other experiment I suggest start from the end point ndash Israelrsquos urgent need to determine our border once we examine debate and then decide on the area we need to hold and where Israelrsquos and Zionismrsquos interest be well serve by exit the path necessary to reach this outcome can be consideredbeyond maintain the integrity of Jerusalem particularly the Old City and its sacred site the core pragmatic requirement be to maximize security and minimize control over and responsibility for the palestinian population in Israel today about identify as jewish as compare to Arabs among the worldrsquos other nationstate base on a dominant ethnic religious or linguistic group as distinct from inherently multicultural country a minority of be already consider quite high particularly when that minority have recidivist claim Borders that would reduce the jewish majority to for example would add significant strain to the zionist jewish hebrewspeake coreIn examine other basic element there be already wide agreement on the need for full control of the strategic Jordan Valley and the main access corridor to defend it similarly the settlement bloc adjacent to the Green Line and within the separation barrier be readily incorporate into Israel without include a large palestinian population there be also a few exception ndash sizable settlement locate in noncontiguous area such as Ariel and Beit El but with population of and respectively abandon they be politically unrealisticthe remain issue concern the future of Area C ndash which under the Oslo accord remain at least in theory under full israeli control extend from Jerusalem east to the Jordan River and north along the Jordan Valley this land be important strategically and have a small palestinian populationnbsphowever in the absence of a coherent policy the Palestinians and their european support team be busy create their own settlement ndash precisely in order to disrupt israeli requirement the palestinian ldquovillagesrdquo that have be create in key location like Khan alAhmar and Masafer Yatta include fictitious backstorie to persuade outsider of their authenticity be attempt to foreclose the option of retain this territory the more time that pass before decide which part of Area C should become part of Israel the more difficult this process will becomethe final dimension concern perception for some Israelis and Diaspora Jews the most painful aspect of the status quo be the image of the jewish state as an occupier portray as brutally deny the Palestinians their own state this be the basis for campus Boycott Divestment and Sanctions resolution and other denunciation of ZionismThe question be whether demonization would decrease significantly if the status quo be replace with declare border particularly if these be recognize by the United States and at least some european country would the Jews who have become hostile to and alienate from Israel because of the ldquooccupationrdquo move to a more positive relationship with israelon these question the evidence be unclear the image of palestinian weakness and victimization in contrast to israeli power will not change regardless of any move in the West Bank and Israel will still be blame however there be reason to expect that among those not committed to the palestinian cause and antizionism the demarcation of border would reduce the hostility nevertheless base on a realistic assessment the potential change in perception of Israel base on the setting of clear border and an end to the temporary ldquooccupationrdquo should not be consider a decide factorIn summary while the result be far from certain ndash and change the status quo after year will be difficult to accomplish particularly in the face of intense ideological opposition ndash the great danger to Israel and Zionism come from continued drift and chaos nbspthe long we allow the illusion of temporary arrangement to fester the more difficult it will be to deal with the result the writer be emeritus professor of political science at BarIlan

jp_277,gaza war must dismantle hamas tunnel flooding on table idf spokesperson the war in the Gaza Strip be continue for its third month and israeli military casualty be mount in an interview with the Media Lines Felice Friedson the Israel Defense Forces international spokesman LtCol Jonathan Conricus discuss the short and longterm goal of the war and say Israel be pay a heavy price but its goal remain unshaken Hamas must be topple he say and the hostage be hold in Gaza who still include woman and child must be return Israel have no other choiceconricus say the israeli army have expose hundred of meter of tunnel some of which be very sophisticated many of the tunnel lead to home and house after house be fill with weapon explosive and rocket launcher one possible scenario for destroy the massive underground city be flood it with seawater an option Conricus didnrsquot dismiss ldquoAt the end of the dayrdquo he tell the Media Line ldquothese tunnel will hopefully be the undoing of HamasrdquoThe Media Line LtCol Jonathan Conricus be the international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces thank you so much for take the time to be with I here at the Media LineLtCol Conricus thank you for have I felicetml on the day that Israel declare war on Hamas those speak on her behalf stress that the path to victory would be a slow one deliberate and costly now some day into the conflict observer be amazed that rocket continue to fly into Israel and that the Hamas fight remain pretty lethal what unexpected have you encounter in the last two monthsLtCol Conricus so wersquove be fight for day since the of October and as we say from the beginning even before we start ground operation in Gaza in order to dismantle Hamas we say that we understand and know that it be go to be a long and difficult fight that unfortunately we be go to have to pay a price in blood in order to achieve our goal and that it will not be easy but that our resolve be very clearAnd all of we soldier in the IDF and officer commander the High Command all understand that we have to dismantle Hamas in order for israeli civilian to be able to go homenow we have see Hamas continue to operate throughout the war and we see that they still retain certain rocket firing and combat capability unfortunately yesterday we have a mass casualty event in Shejaiya in the northern Gaza Strip where israeli soldier be kill from the Golani Brigade and our elite aerial rescue unit our tactical Air Force unit there be still pocket of resistance in northern Gaza and the fight isnrsquot over there there be still rocket launch and there be still tunnel and there be still terrorist there of course greatly degraded but still there and in southern Gaza specifically in Khan Yunis the fighting be ongoing and it will take a lot of time and a lot of effort in order to dismantle Hamas but we shouldnrsquot confuse time and patience with a lack of resolvethe resolve be very clear and we be go to defeat Hamas there be no other optionTML LtCol Conricus look at the bloodshed the loss of life of your soldier do you underestimate do the IDF underestimate the power of HamasLtCol Conricus I think what we can say safely be that Hamas have prioritize their military capability over everything else and we can see as our force advance and as we clear area house neighborhood and part of city from Hamas terrorist after we defeat they and dismantle the enemy activity there what we expose be hundred of mile of tunnel hundred almost a thousand tunnel shaft some of they be very hightech and highlevel and a high finish of infrastructure and we find house after house full of weapon ied explosive rocket launcher and anything that Hamas could get their hand onso what I think I can see be that I think itrsquo clear where Hamas priority have be they definitely have not be develop Gaza care for civilian build civilian infrastructure school and hospital and mosque and road and clinic no it have be in furnish themselves with tunnel and buying and smuggling weapon so that they can go on their continued jihad against Israel that will now be bring to an endhamas will be dismantle and as our force on the ground advance we uncover what Hamas be leave behind Wersquore document everything and wersquore also share it with the world so that everyone can see where international aid have go where it be suppose to have go above ground and where it evidently end up underground in the hand of HamasTML this have be go on for year the smuggling of weapon but do you believe the international community actually believe that today you might be say that here and on many other international program yet public opinion doesnrsquot necessarily say that they agree with the reality on the groundLtCol Conricus I think that the polling indicate not quite what you say because I see very solid support among the US population lot of sympathy towards Israel the israeli government even and definitely Israelis and therersquo a distinction between those threeAnd I think accord to the poll that Irsquove see an overwhelming US majority and Irsquove see poll of western country as well an overwhelming US majority support Israelrsquos quest to dismantle Hamas base on what theyrsquove see what Hamas do on October the atrocity the murder rape the brutal execution and the burning of corpse and all of those atrocity Hamas do that seem distant nowitrsquos be more than two month but itrsquo still very fresh in israeli collective memory People see that and people understand what monster Israel be deal with and therefore people all around the world support Israel in our quest to defend ourselves and I understand that there be certain elite and there be editor and there be politician and people for whom it doesnrsquot fit with their worldview and agenda that Israel should be allow to defend itself and to care for itself and for Israelis to live safely within their internationally recognize border without fear of be under persecution rape and murderBut thatrsquos fine Theyrsquoll continue to harbor their negative view and wersquoll continue to build our country defend ourselves and defeat our enemy as we have be do since the United States be very strong in support the Israel Defense Forcesrsquo action in Gaza there be a bit of a shift you see President Biden put on some very strong pushback at this point and hersquo say that Israel have to pull back Hersquos tell everyone to wrap it up in some form how be this go to impact what the IDF be go to do in the come week whatrsquo the pressure point hereLtCol Conricus I donrsquot see one and on the ground in the IDF that be not the perception that we have what I see in news event and what I see the president say be I stand with Israel and I support Israel and Israel need to get rid of Hamas those be clear word that I understandi see a lot of journalist try to corner the president and get other statement out of he but I see a president steadfast in his support for Israel unflinche and unmoving and I think that be tremendous that be the leadership that be so extremely important in time of war and I see various other important american official include senior spokespeople like John Kirby take a very clear moral position on what need to be do defeat Hamas bring the hostage home and do it in such a way that it minimize collateral damage and damage to civilian which be what we be doingWe do listen to what our ally and friend around the world be say we do take into account the criticism that be voice and we do try to adapt where applicable our tactic on the ground in order to accommodate that and of course we communicate what we be do on the battlefield to the world so that the world can see how we be fight and also very importantly what type of enemy we be fight how the enemy use cynically the civilian at their sotosay disposal that they have in Gaza because itrsquo really how Hamas look at civilian PalestiniansThey think of they as something disposable that they can use in order to get public opinion sway against Israel and for Hamas and in some case it work and some people be call for ceasefire and some people be adopt Hamasrsquo talk point I think thatrsquos very unfortunate but at the end of the day our resolve be very clearwe understand what need to be do and we also understand that really frankly we donrsquot have a choice if we do not defeat Hamas our people Israelis can not go back to live safely in their home and that be a result that be unacceptable and therefore we will continue to fight until Hamas be defeat and our hostage returnedTML there be still a lot of hostage leave in Gaza be you close to get any of they out there be those in the IDF that attempt to bring two back they bring two hostage body back and unfortunately other be kill former Chief of General Staff Gadi Eisenkot his son be kill in that action so what be it go to take be it go to be a constant race to see how you be go to get the hostage out and yet you might lose more man in do soLtCol Conricus it be a tremendous challenge a tactical challenge Itrsquos a very difficult mission to deal with because of how cynically Hamas be use the hostage as bargaining chip and as human shield we have say very clearly from the beginning and continuously that we be go to spare no effort in get our hostage back even if it mean to conduct tactical operation which will put soldier at risk it be our commitment and our duty to bring our hostage backif it can be do through diplomatic mean great if it can not be do through diplomatic mean then we will do it in any other way that be possible at the end of the day our moral and professional obligation be to bring our people backtml what be the number currently how many woman be be hold today in GazaLtCol Conricus as far as I know there be Israelis still hold in Gaza out of which be woman and childrenTML do that include the hostage body that just come back be it down to Conricus I know that be the late number I have base on the late informationtml be it in term of woman at this momentLtCol Conricus as far as I know we be talk about woman and child I could be mistake by one these be move figure after all but in any case the very important thing be that Hamas they themselves violate the agreement that they push so hard in order to achieve in return for a temporary ceasefire or a pause in operationsthey be suppose to return live israeli civilian woman or child every day they fail to do so they violate the term of the agreement and then they also start fire and there be a lot of speculation as to why they do that Irsquom not go to speculate about it but a lot have be say about itbut at the end of the day contrary to Hamas claim there be at least woman and child still hold in Hamas captivity day after the war startedtml the Wall Street Journal just come out with a story that you be flood the tunnel Itrsquos definitely something that have be discuss be there anything that you can share about this with the concern that it can hurt the fresh water that the Gazans will needLtCol Conricus yeah you know Hamas have be dig tunnel for many year and we have be develop different countermeasure and technique in order to deal with tunnel both those tunnel that be dig into Israel what we call terror tunnel in order to infiltrate into Israel and also underground infrastructure that they have inside Gaza which be really the backbone of their combat networki canrsquot go into detail I can say that we be look at different capability and different component we want to turn the tunnel from an asset that Hamas have really to a liability and eventually to their grave and that be our intentionWe be take everything into consideration the location of Israelis who may be hold captive in certain area and other consideration one of they you mention but at the end of the day these tunnel will hopefully be the undoing of HamasTML look ahead be it too early to look ahead for an end game where will the palestinian people be leave how will the israeli border be secure there have to be a strategy that be be discuss at the momentLtCol Conricus Irsquom sure there be yes and itrsquo an important part the IDF be part of the discussion at the cabinet and government level we voice our input when ask when solicit and at the end of the day the IDF will implement the directive give by the governmentI hope as an Israeli that a good and longterm solution can be find one that first and foremost ensure the security and the sense of security for israeli civilian that hopefully soon will be able to go back to their home rebuild their community despite the heavy loss that theyrsquove sustain despite the damage to their beautiful community theyrsquoll have the power theyrsquoll find the powerAnd with the help of the state and other people who will be help also the resource in order to rebuild those community and hopefully make they grow beyond what they be before that be really reliant first and foremost on security be available and stable for those civilian to feel safe in order to return thereand then I hope that the international community will see it fit to join in and help for once fundamentally change the situation in Gaza we will free Gaza of the terrorist organization that rule with an iron fist a heavy hand over Gaza for the last year and that will be an opportunity for positive more advanced force in the region for nation in the region to invest in whatrsquo happen and hopefully bring about a positive and sustainable future for GazaI care mostly about israeli civilian and our security but I also understand that if therersquo prosperity and stability and education for human value and perhaps even democracy on the other side of the border thatrsquos probably a good thing for we as well so I be hopeful that that will happen and Irsquom hopeful that there will be international partner who will see it fit to rise to the challenge and do something good for a change when it come to GazaTML what be the big obstacle that the IDF be face now as theyrsquore try to wrap up this war particularly in the northLtCol Conricus yeah I donrsquot think wersquore quite there yet mentally we be definitely not think about wrap up we be kneedeep in fighting and there still be a lot of heavy lifting to be do Hamas still have combat capability in southern Gaza and still need to be eliminatedwe still need to take out the leadership their command and control and to dismantle and take away their military and administrative and financial capability so thatrsquos still ahead of usin the north if yoursquore refer to Hizbullah then there be also a very significant challenge as I say before regard Gaza I think itrsquo very clear that we can not ask our civilian to return to their home and to be at risk of relive the atrocity of October the that happen along the Gaza border and that the security situation need to changethe Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi say so very clearly when he speak with local leader before we ask you to go back before we tell you that itrsquo safe to go back we will make sure that itrsquo safe and that the situation on the ground will not go back to what it be on October the the first choice that Israel can take or the first option that we will entertain be not the kinetic military violence one but if we be leave with no other choice if diplomacy fail and other option will fail then of course Israel will have to deal with the situation and will have to deal with the presence of this iranian proxy at our doorstep hundred of yard away from israeli community that be unacceptable and it will not be the reality after the warletrsquos hope that people nation and institution that have an interest in the safety of Israelis and the integrity of the state of Lebanon will intervene soon enough so as to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and destruction and the horror that a war between Israel and Hizbullah may entailtml Videos be circulate show Hamas take over humanitarian aid thatrsquos designate for their own people what can you add to that in term of what yoursquore go through in try to get people to the right place suggest where it might be a safe zone and also the obstacle there in term of get humanitarian aid to the populationLtCol Conricus Hamas color be shine through and itrsquo another example of how they have absolutely no regard for palestinian civilian they be just use they as cannon fodder as human shield and as pawn in their political effort against Israel Thatrsquos very cynical but itrsquo very obvious for anybody who be honest enough and can seeyeah so the true color of Hamas be show Itrsquos evident that they absolutely have no regard for civilian or palestinian civilian they continue to use they as their human shield and as expendable asset in their political game against IsraelWe see they loot UNRWA warehouse we see they take over humanitarian truck and convoy we see they steal fuel we see they steal food and medicine that be intend through the generous aid of the US and the help of Egypt and many other part of the international community they be intend for good humanitarian purpose and many around the world hope that it will get to their civilian addressesbut at the end of the day Hamas have one goal their goal be jihad holy war against Israel they want to annihilate Israel they want to do the October massacre again and again and again and for that aim they have no problem take humanitarian aid with steal fuel or with take food that be intend for palestinian child in hospital in Gaza and bring underground into their tunnel for their fighter to have instead of civilian so itrsquo abundantly clearwersquove been say all along that Hamas abuse the civilian population our hope be that more and more people around the world will see reality and acknowledge the fact that Hamas be violate everything that be suppose to be holy and any of the basic tenet of humanity they be commit crime against humanity on a daily basisand I hope really hope that the UN and other humanitarian organization will finally come around and speak the truth about whatrsquo happen in Gaza and call Hamas out for what it be a terrorist organization that brutally abuse the civilian population and it be about high time that UNRWA and other organization call out Hamas for what it be and start help we save Palestinians from the horror of warfare and get they out of the battle zone provide they with international humanitarian aid and make sure that it doesnrsquot go into the wrong hand of HamasTML the clock be tick and the family of the hostage be deeply concerned that they may not see their love one itrsquos a big difficulty for the Israel Defense Forces especially now when you be push forward with possibly flood tunnel what do you do how do you secure those hostage at this momentLtCol Conricus as I say itrsquo a very very sensitive topic and an extremely complex and very challenging mission because of the sensitivity I canrsquot go into the exact detail of the tactic of it what I can say be that it be a top priority of the IDF to get all of the hostage back we spare no effort in intelligence manpower and resource in locate the hostage and try to bring they homeunfortunately one effort that we conduct a few day ago end with we only be able to return the body of hostage but we will continue to collect intelligence devise plan and where feasible execute plan in order to get the people backwe be aware of the situation and I think that one thing that should be say be that for day these Israelis have be hold in inhumane condition and the Red Cross have not yet find the ability or the political will to actually go implement their mandate and visit these hostage many of they be woman child and civilian but soldier have right as well under the Geneva Conventions all of they be entitle to a visit by the Red Cross to make sure that they be receive medical help that they be safe and that their basic need be take care ofthat be whatrsquos suppose to happen sadly it have not yet happen and it wouldnrsquot be a minute too soon once the Red Cross actually get access and implement its mandatetml LtCol Jonathan Conricus international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces thank you for your time and I wish you strengthLtCol Conricus thank you thank you felice

then his seat be fill by two other IsraeliArabs First George Karra for a short term and now by Khaled KabubIn that regard Joubran convince the Jews of Israel that the courtrsquos identity must somewhat reflect the countryrsquos multireligious nature and convince the Arabs of Israel that partnering with israeli society can be worth it and have real resultsNot everything be perfect there be an incident in when Joubran come under attack by many in the political sphere when he stand for the singing of ldquohatikvahrdquo during a state ceremony but he clearly do not sing the wordsultimately Joubran weather the storm with many mainstream political and judicial official point out that as long as he stand and convey respect that neither he nor IsraeliArab soldier could be expect to sing about jewish longing to return to their homelandorthodox former deputy chief justice Elyakim Rubinstein be one of those who publicly come to Joubranrsquos defense at the time and he eulogize Joubran last week as one of his close friend in the courtmost of the time though Joubran manage to stay out of and above politicsHe represent Israel around the world and serve as one of its bright light in embody israeli multicultural coexistencewhenever critic try to tear Israel down as discriminate against Arabs the example of Joubran could be roll out as a stark contrast to that narrativejoubran be involve in a myriad of historic decisionsHe be on the panel of three justice who reject the appeal of former president Moshe Katsav send he to prison for seven year for rape and sexual abuselikewise he be on the bench of five justice who reject part of the appeal of former prime minister Ehud Olmert send he to jail for two plus year on various charge of public corruptionever the independent

ministerrsquos brother Yossi Olmert have they listen to Joubran Olmert would have spend many more year in prisonregarding equality issue he be a consistent and unabashedly liberal voice whether for Jews or for Arabs he write soar opinion about justice and fairness that even his conservative critic sometimes respect more than they respect quieter closet activist who often rule liberally but try to frame themselves in technical nonactivist termsIn his final case ndash a ruling on samesex couplesrsquo surrogacy right ndash Joubran say that he find it difficult to come to term with a situation in which single people and samesex couple be block from fulfil their dream to become parent through surrogacy agreementsHe say he could not see the justice of give preference to heterosexual parent over samesex parent though the court as a whole defer the issue for six month to give the Knesset time to resolve legislation on the issue which it be already consideringIn addition Joubran advocate religious freedom and pluralism for Jews often bang head with the haredi rabbinic establishmentregarde IsraeliArab equality he dissent in a major razorthin Supreme Court decision which keep a law in place that allow ldquoacceptance committeesrdquo to vet and reject candidate use vague criterion for around yishuvim village in the Negev and the GalileeThat law replace an early law previously strike down by the Supreme Court which explicitly permit discrimination against IsraeliArabs in those villageshowever Joubran and three other dissent justice say that the new law would be use to achieve the same outcome and impact as the old law of discriminate against IsraeliArabs and possibly sometimes against haredim or other minority group this be even if at face value the new law do not explicitly discriminatethe new brand of moderateformalist activist ally with a grow group of conservative to keep the law but unapologetic liberal like Joubran could not stand a law which would likely cause inequality even if there be technical reason to avoid or delay strike the law until it play out more in the real worldIn in the High Courtrsquos decision Joubran get to vote in the majority against justice Noam Sohlberg invalidate a price freeze and cap on legal liability rule that be part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahursquos natural gas policyjoubran also vote in the majority against Sohlberg and thenjustice Esther Hayut to suspend the policy for a year while the government would adjust the price and liability issuesBut in that same series of ruling the Supreme Court affirm virtually all of the many other aspect of the policy by a majority with only Joubran dissentingthis include empower Netanyahu to override and circumvent objection of the antitrust authority on the ground of national securitythis be hugethe prime minister act as his own economy minister could override the antitrust authority on a question of economic use national security as a reasonjoubran have no problem switch back to be in the minority on that issue to check what he regard as executive power overreachcritic would say that Joubran harm the countryrsquos economic development and impose his own world view in place of the representative of the voter NetanyahuBut Joubran view the court as the last line of defense of those in society who be weak and if that mean protect the antitrust authority in a way that slow down economic development he be at peace with that unlike other liberal justice he be willing to say it out loudI meet Joubran a number of time at conference and Supreme

would welcome Mondayrsquos Security Council resolution it be also equally clear why it reject the hostage deal on the tablehama welcome the resolution despite its call for an immediate release of all

the second part of that same clause a call for Hamas to release all the hostageswhy will the world not press the second part of that clause because it know full well that Hamas operate way outside the bound of civil society and that the terrorist organization be not go to heed any such callIt be also clear follow the resolution that Hamas would stiffen its condition on a hostage deal sense that if it just hold out long international pressure will force Israel to stop the war enable the terrorist group to survive to fight ndash meaning to murder rape and mutilate ndash another day Security

be misplacedput aside whether as a result of the US failure to veto the resolution it be wise for Netanyahu to cancel Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Council head Tzachi Hanegbirsquos trip to Washington this week to consult on how to pursue the war in Rafah it wasnrsquot and whether move such as these have political motivation they do Nevertheless Netanyahu be not always to blame in these confrontation with America nor be Biden always free of faultdont assume that another pm would have well relation with the USOn Tuesday one lead columnist write in Yediot Aharonot ldquoDo we need anything more than what be happen in our relation with America to understand the abyss the prime minister be lead we into what else need to happen to understand that every additional day he sit in his chair our international situation deteriorate and the crisis with our big and only friend ndash our arm supplier ndash get worserdquoThe columnist assume that be someone else sit in the prime ministerrsquos chair right now with the war in Gaza in its sixth month and picture of Palestinians suffer flood the traditional and social medium in the West Israelrsquos situation in the world would be any betterbut that be an erroneous assumptionHad even Yesh Atidrsquos Yair Lapid be prime minister when October happen it be hard to believe that the countryrsquos policy toward Hamas and the idfrsquos way of prosecute the war would be that significantly different from what they be now while perhaps there would be more of an emphasis on the ldquoday afterrdquo and a more receptive ear to international plea for more humanitarian aid into Gaza Israel would have the same war aim it have now of destroy Hamasrsquos capabilitiesthat aim ndash unfortunately because of the way Hamas have choose to fight ndash will lead to a high number of palestinian civilian casualty and much palestinian suffering regardless of who be sit in the Prime Ministerrsquos Office and it be those casualty and that suffer that more than anything be drive the wedge between Jerusalem and WashingtonIf you doubt this look back to the day of the Naftali Bennett and Lapid tagteam government and think whether israelrsquos position among the progressive Democrats in the US be that much well than it be under Netanyahu it wasnrsquot because the antiisrael progressive and ldquosocial justice activistsrdquo who be all impact Bidenrsquos policy right now during an election year be oppose not only to Netanyahu but to Israel itself regardless of who lead the countryIn their mind Israel be an instrument of white supremacy and imperialism and regardless of the identity of the prime minister or composition of his government the jewish state would still be an illegitimate racist colonialist enterprise in their eyesus official be quote as say that Netanyahursquos decision not to send Dermer and Hanegbi to Washington for consultation be motivate by political consideration and they be probably right be see as willing to stand up to US pressure play well politically with Netanyahursquos basebut there be something disingenuous in this criticism of Netanyahu for let political consideration influence his policy be not political consideration now also heavily influence Bidenrsquos policy in this crisislast month the US veto a similar resolution at the Security Council call for an immediate ceasefire why do it not do the same thing now what change in the interimseveral thing change among they be that the casualty figure in Gaza continue to rise and another be that Biden be getting pound by progressive Democrats and arab Americans for his support of IsraelBidenrsquos tone and the tone of his administration have change markedly in the last two month and that have to do with arab Americans vote ndash or not vote ndash in Michigan and with progressive unenthuse by the Biden campaign harshly critical of his Israel policy and threaten either to vote for a third party candidate or stay at home on Election Day November Biden and Netanyahu be political animal and both be use their disagreement for their own political purpose but to say this be all Netanyahursquos fault and that israelrsquos position in the world and in Washington would be sterling even amid a war such as this if someone else be call the shot in Jerusalem be unrealisticthis doesnrsquot mean that Netanyahursquos handling of the relationship with the US during the war have be flawless it most definitely have notFor example Netanyahu could have play Mondayrsquos Security Council resolution completely differently ndash accept a twoweek ceasefire for the duration of Ramadan to win favor with the Biden administration and the world and then resume fighting at the end of the muslim holy month if Hamas do not release the hostage at that point Israel could say that it fulfil the resolution but Hamas do not ndash place the onus on the terrorist organizationnetanyahu could have do thing differently but not all the tension in the relationship can be dump on his doorstep Netanyahu ndash with all his fault ndash be not always wrong nor be Biden ndash with all the support he have give Israel since October ndash always right as various opposition leader and lead voice in the medium lament the current tension in the relationship would have one believemondayrsquos Security Council resolution be a case in point

jp_356,the speech that a patriotic prime minister should deliver in the face of war opinion Israel have begin what look like a limited operation in Rafah but seven month after October the parameter have not change half the hostage have not return no alternative to Hamas have be allow to emerge in Gaza Israelrsquos international standing have collapse its relationship with the US be on the rock the economy have take a hit antisemitism be skyrocket and much of country be convince the government be prolong the crisis to stay in power Itrsquos clearly not greatnow imagine an alternative universe in which Israel be lead by a morally upstanding patriot who care about the countryrsquos reputation and the fate of Jews worldwide imagine that the prime minister understand the power of word to do good and of public diplomacy to persuade and imagine ndash why not ndash that this be Benjamin NetanyahuWhether or not a limited hostage deal be somehow reach in the come day such a prime minister could flip the entire narrative dramatically at any moment by hold an Englishlanguage news conference aim at the world and contain honest truth and easytounderstand message with zero political schemingFor starter hersquod express deep regret over the loss of life in gazaldquoi know it have be severe although I be not inclined to believe Hamas number we do our good with a situation in which Hamas use the population as a human fortification unlike any that history have see and seem to seek as much lsquomartyrdomrsquo as possible Hamas be evil incarnate and I weep for the Palestinians who be saddle with such maniacal rulersrdquo that part of the message should be beam to every US college campusHe would make clear that Israel have no desire to occupy Gaza and no intention of compel the population to flee ldquoWe be only there to remove the threat that attack we on October unprovoked massacre over people and promise with great arrogance to do it againldquoI ask every Palestinian what would you have recommend that we do at that point wait for they then to do it again Irsquom genuinely curious be that what you would have donerdquoA departure from cynicism and selfrighteousnessnbspthe prime minister would say these last word without the kind of smirk selfrighteous cynicism wersquove come to expect he would sound like a mensch make each listener feel personally address Thatrsquos because the prime minister be no fool and know that empathy beget empathy and sometimes even sympathythe PRIME MINISTER would at this point diverge not only from the style but from the content that have characterize Netanyahu hitherto he would say he be prepared to end the war right now in exchange for all remain hostagesHe would look into the camera and speak slowly word that will be replay on every television station in the arab world ldquodear Palestinians dear people of Gaza the war can end right now this minute ndash this very second no more death and destruction Life and reconstruction instead it be the decision of HamasrdquoHe would make clear that Israel want to engage the world the region and the Palestinians in a dayafter plan and he would offer the Palestinians a choice ndash after the hostage have all be releasedone option would be for Israel to pull out of Gaza and let the chip fall where they may which probably mean Hamas will remain in power despite its military degradationldquofor we to do this there be a major precondition the group must commit itself to never again attack Israel from Gaza ndash not with rocket not with explode balloon and definitely not with an invasion by armed barbarian this must be declare by the Political Bureau in document submit to the Arab League we understand it be unlikely but we be give you this choice if you take it then something good will have come of this war I will sell this to the israeli people Letrsquos see you explain yourself to the people of GazardquoIf Hamas be unwilling to do this ndash and it be close to a certainty that it wonrsquot ndash then it would have a second option as well the prime minister would explain that Israel would allow the entire leadership of the organization and anyone who participate in October ndash thousand of bloodthirsty fanatic and fool ndash to leave the Strip in a flotilla guard by the United States Navy and head to whatever country agree to take they Turkey and Qatar be deserve candidate Israel would undertake not to attack they there in the future as wellHere the prime minister would finally address what Israel would like to see happen in the Strip the day after Hamas he would jettison the selfdefeate boycott of the Palestinian Authority say that the PA would be invite to return to Gaza from which it be expel by Hamas in he would add that Israel would be hope that the PA revise the problematic school curriculum in which pupil be not educate for peace and that it would need to accept assistance from Israel or from an arab force on security in the territoryHe would add that Israel would in exchange for acquiescence in these area offer extremely significant financial aid to rebuild the Strip and set it on the road to a reasonable degree of prosperitythe prime minister would also mention the elephant in the room ndash the world communityrsquo desire to see a twostate solution in which the West Bank issue be also resolve repeat word Netanyahu and other israeli leader have say in the past the prime minister would explain that Israel do not want to forever govern the Palestinians because it aim to be a democratic Jewishmajority country but he would add that therersquo a catchldquowhat happen on October make it impossible for we to remove the military completely from the West Bank because if that territory fall into the same hand that attack we from Gaza the damage would be many time greaterldquofor this you have Hamas to blame every person who support Hamas support continue a level of threat against we that do not allow progress therefore address the security danger ndash which be a real danger for we and not paranoia ndash be the key we will be work on this with all our partner but we need some time Letrsquos focus first on a real solution for gazardquohe would conclude with a broad message that will resonate around the world ldquopalestinian and arab friend and also enemy we want peace but we will not roll over the jewish people be in Israel to stay work with we and you will find a supporter and a champion the past seven month have offer a glimpse of the hell that await we if the radical prevail Letrsquos instead ensure that this never occur againrdquothe prime minister will have not commit to anything that Israel should not itself desire ndash but the deck will have be completely reshuffle even if Hamas reject all the option among serious people in the world there will be clarity at last and Israel would have international legitimacy to press on this be good because there be no great advantage in dwell aloneI know ndash the prime minister who do this can not be Netanyahu it really do appear that basically nothing drive he but a lust for power and the most vulgar

caution against hyperbole nbsp ldquoI donrsquot think there be pressurerdquo he say ldquoI think that what the Americans be say be that they want to see a ceasefire but that be not pressure they understand the need for Israel to complete the operation they understand we be talk about a terrorist organization that cross all redline open fire on israeli city therefore the administration give we time nbsp ldquoI make no pretense of understand how America worksrdquo say Amidror a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security ldquoI look at what they have do and what they have do up until now be to give we the time we neededrdquo nbsp Amidror say he be not surprised by this since the leadership in the Democratic Party ndash ldquocontrary to the perception hererdquo ndash still maintain ldquocheck and balance over the radical progressive element within the party that sometimes contain antisemitic elementsrdquo nbsp what be ironic about Bidenrsquos support be that it have disappoint some on the right because it disrupt their narrative that Biden be a reincarnation of Barack Obama who will squeeze Israel at the first opportunity and at the same time have also disappoint some on the Left who would like to see much less support for Israel nbsp there be also israeli domestic agenda at work among those who want to characterize Bidenrsquos comment as ldquopressurerdquo

of solidarity nbsp Shiron attribute this primarily to the few civilian casualty in Gaza than in the past ldquoThe collateral damage be less and we be see few picture of dead and injured and child even though there be always civilian casualty nbsp ldquoThe number of casualty in Gaza be less because the IDF and the air force have learn lesson from the past and as a result pressure come from various

in the past and allow it to carry out its operation accord to its own timeline say there be three main reason for this degree of understanding among many world government nbsp First he say be israeli restraint over incident from Gaza in the week before Hamas fire rocket toward Jerusalem on May Second be that it be clear to the government around the world who start the conflagration nbsp ldquoand the third thing be that they be shoot at civilian target while everyone understand we be shoot at military onesrdquo Amidror say ldquosometime we err and civilian be kill but our intent ndash and the direction of our fire ndash be toward military target while they be shoot at civilian from among civiliansrdquo nbsp Amidror say that even those critical of recent israeli action in Jerusalem such as effort to evict four family from Sheikh Jarrah and police activity during Ramadan at the Damascus Gate understand that there be huge gap between the claim of israeli error in this matter and the response nbsp ldquoThere be disproportionality between the claim against we and the reaction for the sake of argument letrsquos say that they be right that our behavior could have be gentler in Jerusalem do that justify rocket on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there be tremendous disproportionalityrdquo nbsp but that disproportionality ldquoplay into our handsrdquo Amidror say as ldquoreasonable

value ldquojews dominate finance and internet sector so do they have the powerful lobby some say Possiblerdquo nbsp Amidror take umbrage ldquothere be a big difference between be for a ceasefire and

Presidential Medal of Freedom in he be the only live nonamerican citizen who be the recipient of these two high american awardsclearly there be almost nothing in the jewish world and in Israel that Sharansky have not be involve with in one way or another in the course of his life at this challenging time it seem appropriate to discuss current event with SharanskyThese be difficult time for we as a people as a country as a society how have you feel since October course there be a huge failure here of our intelligence our army and our politician we be deeply invest in incorrect concept for I it all start back with Oslo I say then that the idea of our bring a dictator to the Palestinians who would make peace with we mdash because we would make he a dictator by give he a lot of money mdash do not make sense its just the reverse the dictator would need we as enemy and therefore would not make peace with usIt continued even with the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip AW the idea be that we would be here and they would be there and we could control they that way as Prime Minister Arik Sharon explain to I if they turn militant and try something we would go in I resign from the government at that time because of the disengagementwe have become a united societysharansky believe it be the spirit of Oslo that cause Israels leadership at all level to act incorrectly and lead to the failure of October on the other hand this event be a reminder of how good it be that we have the State of Israel there be a poet who write that the proximity of israeli Memorial Day and Holocaust Day help we understand the price of the world with a state and without a state when we be in the Soviet Union and there be a surge of antisemitism could we could fight go to court no we just have to get by take refuge in mathematic and physics perhaps they d leave we alone even after people be kill in pogrom there be nothing to be do but to run away to AmericaNow we be fight Sharansky declare proudly we have transform from a most divide society into a united society we be all sit in one tank and our appreciation for the State of Israel have be renew and as much as we call the young generation a tiktok one it turn out this generation be give we a lesson in true Zionism in such a noble such a brave way so good thing be happen I be optimistic about the future of the State of Israel but far less optimistic about what be happen in America and EuropeSharansky try to explain what he think be happen nowadays in the West both in the jewish context and the wide one the Jews feel they be part of the liberal world and the liberal world think the progressive be their partner for year I write about the fact that the real crisis in the United States be not between Republicans and Democrats but between liberal and progressive I say that one day the liberal would realize they be not partnersIn his various role Sharansky meet with many Jews in the West I ask Jews at university in the most elite place if any of the organization they have develop relationship with befriend over the year express any sympathy after October I be not ask for anything more just sympathy they look and look and find one rightleane organization at Yale that participate in mourn that s it this mean that all the organization on the progressive left see the terrible thing that happen on October as part of a legitimate struggle this be a big change antisemitism come out in a big waySharansky say in the past he have theory about how to prove a connection between antisemitism and antizionism today we no long need a theory we do not need to show anything it be in everyday life I hope that the new generation of american Jews will go out in public and fight over this ityou say you be encourage by the unity here but there be a repeat of the tension we see before October be not therethere be a comeback but a group of politician and a group of journalist be behind it the masse be not with they today unlike what happen until October when half the country think the other half be try to steal their democracy and the other half think they be try to steal their Judaism today the people feel that it be important for everyone that there be a jewish state and also a free country and you can see this with almost every bereaved family of a fall soldier also we see that in the moment of truth suddenly the real and deep thing that unite we still exist they be not lostmarxism be backI speak not long ago with a researcher name Izabella Tabarovsky who believe that the antizionist rhetoric and progressive left activity stem from the soviet attitude towards Zionism and Israel do you agree with this analysisYes of course I think Izabella be right there be a large group of people who leave he Soviet Union who understand much well than most Americans what exactly happen in America the whole postmodern ideology that divide the world into oppress and oppressor be neomarxism in its most primitive form in the study of critical race theory mdash which have become the Koran of the progressive mdash if you replace race with class you get the ideology of the Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union there too the whole war be between one good side and one bad side between the proletariat and the capitalist the capitalist be always wrong and should not be give freedom of speech mdash aside from those who be consider politically correct and the capitalist world should be destroy completely and a just world will be build on this it be very sad that Marxism have come back after such a huge failure it have come back

through his lawyerA physical letterA handwritten letter that be photocopied and send to my emailand what do he sayhe say we do not know each other but he be write to I as a reader to a writer because he have read my book and be amazed at how much the situation have go back to what it be when I be in the Gulag during my year in prison I spend day in isolation Navalny be already almost day in isolation it be clear from his letter that he be a free man and of course I write that I admire he and his struggle it be clear this be a very strong man that he be optimistic not because of what be happen with he but that he be optimistic about the victory of his struggle we have an exchange of letter and we have a good feeling towards one anotherwhat be in his last letter to youIn the last letter right before he enter the isolation cell again he write to I I receive a letter from you and I do not know when I will be able to write to you again so I be simply write to you what be interesting be that he end the letter with the word next year in Jerusalem in russian letter mdash the last word in my book as if he want to join the optimism of jewish historyyou be one of the personage most identify with the word freedom what be freedom to youFreedom be when you can do and say thing you believe in in this respect in prison I be much free than those who interrogate I during the interrogation I really like to tell antisoviet joke about Brezhnev the guard be almost burst but could not laugh because of the consequence and I would say to they well you want to tell I that I be in prison you re in prison mdash you can not laugh for I freedom be very much related to identity because we find the strength to fight for our identity only when we become a free people and vice versathe fact that the West itself have lose its identity be connect to everything we see now and here Israel have a special role we be part of the free world yet still insist on maintain our identity as a jewish statehow do you feel about the judicial overhaul the conduct of the government and all the demonstrationsi thought both side be wrong there be no reason for Netanyahu who come to power for a fouryear term to try in two month to introduce a law that change thing so significantly I agree with most of the element of the reform except for a few thing but they want to do everything immediately it be a huge mistake Lets say that in the first week Bibi do not understand that Minister of Justice Yariv Levin be rush something okay but after ten week you can already understand it be a mistakeon the other hand the demonstration shout to the whole world that this be the end of democracy that this be a dictatorship that this be the end of women freedom mdash I think that be irresponsible once one of the organizer of the demonstration ask I why do not you come to our demonstration I ask why do you shout that this be the end of democracy he tell I without it we would not be able to bring along so many people that s cynicaltoo many year in powersharansky have know Benjamin Netanyahu since he be a diplomat ask his opinion about Netanyahu and his performance these day he reply that Bibi be a great politician a great leader its not by chance that he have be at the head of this country for so long when I be in the government I see how he fight to liberalize the economy thank to he mdash and I be there mdash there s the TaglitBirthright project not to mention the fact that he be first in the world to understand the iranian threat and when he be Prime Minister and Minister of Finance he begin advance the sanction he also take office after the Oslo Accords when there be many commitment in place and he manage to moderate themfollowing this praise Sharansky come to his problem with Netanyahu I think it be not good when a politician stay in power for too long I tell this to Bibi when I leave my position at the jewish agency he ask I perhaps you d like another term I answer Bibi more than two term be not healthy he ask be you tell I that and I say yes you too when you be in a post like that for a long time you begin to feel that the good thing for the country would be for you to stay in power mdash and then that become the goal and there be no doubt that he have also contribute to the divisiveness here the fact that he start use the word leftist as word describe an enemy be very badhe should have finish up and prepare a new generation to replace he but he feel that there be noone who could replace he to save the country and think I need to stay in power and this I think be a mistake but I will emphasize again that his contribution to the country have nonetheless be great

jp_492,demolish house do not stop terror in why do it work in analysis in February during the government of thenprime minister Ariel Sharon thendefense minister Shaul Mofaz and IDF chief Moshe Yarsquoalon order a moratorium of punitive house demolition against the family of palestinian terroristsA commission of top defense expert lead by MajGen re Udi Shani have empirically study whether house demolition over the last few year of the Second Intifada have increase deterrence against terrorist conclude that the opposite be trueYet in it seem that nearly the entire defense establishment be convince that house demolition do deter future potential terror attacksthey be so sure that they even want to seal off the house of the family of the Palestinian who shoot but do not kill two israeli victim ndash which would be the first time that such a measure would be take against an attempt murderer versus an actual murdererwhat if anything change between and about Israel the Palestinians house demolition and deterrenceThe committee find that house demolition rather than deter future terrorism generally inflame hatred and increase motivation for future attack by Palestinians against IsraelAccording to the defense commission there have only be case in which the threat of demolition deter potential attacker or push their family to turn they in ndash out of hundred of demolition since the commission report simply point out that after hundred of demolition the Second Intifada have not be put downfurthermore the report say that in many case house demolition hit family which other than the one terrorist attacker be not part of a great terror group and be view by the great palestinian public as illegitimate collective punishmentthis mean that sometimes new terrorist be even be create from family or neighbor of these family who might not have become a problemanother part of the problem the committee say be that different palestinian group whether the Palestinian Authority Hamas or otherwise frequently compensate family of terrorist and help they rebuild new home weaken possible deterrencein addition if there have be some short period early in the Second Intifada when a small number of demolition might have have a deterrent effect as the policy go on long the deterrent effect be lostwith some very limited exception Israel stop demolish palestinian house for punitive deterrent purpose from ndash almost a decadeit be after palestinian terrorist murder three jewish teenager that the thengovernment of Benjamin Netanyahu who go almost five year without demolition reinstate the demolition policythe issue be probe again by the Shin Bet Israel Security Agency during the Knife Intifada but this time the overwhelming majority of official find that the demolition be have a deterrent effectsignificant number of Palestinians who start toward an attack but relent or parent who turn in their kid before they could commit an attack in process say that save the family house have impact they greatlysome official do a victory lap on the issue in as one of the reason ndash along with new technology and analysis of social medium ndash that the Knife Intifada be put down before it blow up into a ldquofull IntifadardquoThe Jerusalem Post recently receive additional confirmation from defense official deal with some of the great palestinian violence in the northern West Bank which conclude that demolition be still provide deterrencethey repeat the same update testimony of Palestinians not just rely on the datum who pull back from terror at the last minute or turn in their kid to stop they from terrorone fascinating point be that some of these official do not even know that Israelrsquos moratorium on house demolition have go on for so long nearly a decade in fact they be quite shocked by the notionpart of what be interesting about that be that the year ndash without house demolitions ndash be a much less violent time period than have be with house demolitionsOf course one counterresponse to this argument be that this be because the IDF hit palestinian terror much hard and deeply during the Second Intifada and it be this that provide quietsome also say that if the IDF do house demolition fast not with week or month of delay then there would be great deterrence maybe but there be no guarantee there either and there have be case where a terroristrsquos family have nothing to do with their activity and rush forward without figure that out would have break even israeli law as it currently exist keep in mind that though international law have a place for house demolition Israel be an outlier among democracy in actually perform themsome other question worth askingBut it be worth ask when israeli defense official in say they be sure that demolition provide deterrence be they fully and seriously consider the opposing viewif some of they do not even recall a world without house demolition can they be say to fully consider that viewAnd if Israel have be do they more aggressively than ever since March without end the current wave of violence what do that saythere be no easy answer to these question but they be question that could be crucial to ask by security professional who seriously consider both side and who ignore partisan noise for and against the demolition on either political side of the

jp_560,israel already need a plan for the day after it topple hamas analysis on US President Joe Bidenrsquos flight to Tel Aviv on Wednesday National Security spokesperson John Kirby say Biden would be ask Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ldquosome tough questionsrdquoamong those tough question be certainly one about what Israel would do to prevent as many civilian casualty as possible inside Gaza what Israel would do to prevent a humanitarian crisis and how Jerusalem plan to respond to Hezbollah provocation in the northand one of those tough question be surely a simple one what be the endgame what be Israelrsquos plan and vision for the Gaza Strip the day afterIsrael clearly state the goal of this war to destroy Hamas and remove its control over Gaza but what happen the day after then whatamid the horror shock and fury that have grip this country since October there have be little public discussion inside Israel of this issue and the future of the Gaza StripFrom an israeli point of view this be entirely understandable with the blood still boil from the horrific Simchat Torah massacre the countryrsquos focus be simply on uproot Hamas on deliver the terrorist organization a mortal blownbspeverything else can wait include apportion blame and responsibility for the catastrophe and think about what come nextbut for Washington a ldquowewilldealwiththislaterrdquo attitude be not enough and for Biden to be able to sell continued support for Israel to his party and his country he obviously want to know what policy he be support and what Israel want to do after Hamas be expelledHamas Shortterm vs longterm goalsdelivere a devastating blow to Hamas and remove they from power in Gaza be shortterm goal but what be the longterm goal this be important to define because some will only support shortterm goal if they know the longterm planand this place Israel in a dilemma because it have never articulate any longterm plan for GazaBefore October Israelrsquos policy toward Gaza could be sum up as contain terrorism until Hamas either realize that it be not in their interest to pursue terror or something big happen and it be drive from powerwell now something big have happen and Israel be determined to drive Hamas from power Biden come here partly to hear from Israel what come nextOn the face of it the option be rather limitedthe first option be that Israel reoccupie Gaza either the whole area or part of it and remain there indefinitelythe logic behind this be that the only way to ensure that once kick out Hamas do not return be for Israel to be in controlwhile two week ago this idea would have be dismiss as the ranting of the farright the Simchat Torah atrocity have bring discussion of that into the mainstream even though President Isaac Herzog have say publicly that Israel have no intention of do this the idea be out therein a interview on Sunday Biden relate to this and say that in his estimation such a move would be a ldquobig mistakerdquo he certainly make that position clear in his meeting here on WednesdayAfter dismantle Hamas a second option be for Israel to hand control of it and its more than two million resident to the palestinian AuthorityThe problem with this option be that the Palestinian Authority both weak and highly unpopular among Palestinians can barely control the area in the West Bank currently under its control let alone take on a much big projectnbspIn this scenario hand Gaza over to the PA which the Palestinian Authority lose control of in in a bloody coup would likely necessitate Israel retain the right to enter the Gaza Strip as it do currently in palestinian town in the West Bank for security reasonsA third option would be for Egypt to take control of the area something egyptian President Abdel Fattah alSisi have make abundantly clear he have no interest in doingand another option would be for Gaza to come under the administration of some kind of international consortium perhaps an international peacekeeping team or a group of state from the Organization of Islamic ConferenceThis option too be consider unrealistic First few country be bite at the bit to take on this chore Second Israelrsquos experience with international peacekeeper keep terrorist group out of territory have not be good as evidence by the situation in southern Lebanon where peacekeeper have be unable to keep Hezbollah from take control and threaten IsraelIn addition invite international actor into an area where Israel might continuously need to engage militarily be only invite troublesince none of those possibility be particularly attractive develop other perhaps more creative idea be need to present as an endgamehaving an endgame be essential not only to answer Bidenrsquos question but also for other reason include to help israelrsquos public diplomacy effort as the war grind on and the focus as be already the case move from the October massacre to the devastation in GazaIsraeli spokespeople interview about the situation have so far be able to deflect question about an endgame by say ldquofirst thing firstrdquo first let the country defeat Hamas and then Israel will deal with the future of GazanbspBut the countryrsquos public diplomacy effort would be help if the spokespeople say ldquoWe be destroy Hamas today and this be what we want to see happen tomorrowrdquoin the need for an endgame Israel should learn from the experience of the SixDay War Israel win that war but never succeed in clearly define what it hope to see down the line it never define clearly and still have not define clearly what its endgame be for Judea and Samaria and it suffer from that lack of claritya the Palestinians demand a complete return to the line Israel always say what it want depend on what the Arabs say what the Americans want and what the Palestinians would agree to but Israel never state clearly what it want to do with the territory it always depend but depend be not policy one can not achieve what one do not defineisrael already need to define what it want to see happen in Gaza when the war end and Hamas be destroy only then maybe will this be achievable

jp_569,idf arrest director of gazas shifa hospital The IDF and the Shin Bet Israel Security Agency around pm Thursday afternoon finally admit to having arrest the director of Shifa Hospital which have be at the center of medium narrative battle between Israel and Hamas in GazaFirst report in the palestinian and hebrew medium about his arrest surface already much early Thursday morningquestione repeatedly early in the morning about why he have be arrest and why no official announcement have go out israeli and IDF official response alternate from surprise at the event to a promise that an announcement would go out soonHowever even the pm announcement do not make any direct charge against the Shifa chiefrather the announcement say that he have be arrest and bring to the Shin Bet for interrogation after significant testimony and video evidence from other that Shifa have be use as a command center for Hamas during the director tenurethe statement state the terror group Hamas utilize many resource include electricity in order to strengthen its tunnel which it build under the hospital in addition Hamas keep military item store in the hospital and in its immediate surroundingsin addition the statement read that after the October Hamas mass terror attack on Israels South the terror group use the hospital as a refuge for its terror force and even bring israeli hostage to there who be kidnap during the day of slaughter a pathology report confirm that soldier Noa Marciano be murder on the ground of Shifa HospitalNext the statement say vaguely that a decision regard his detention would be make in conjunction with the finding of the investigation regard his involvement with the hospital connection to terrorthere be a number of possible scenario about how this could play outIf Israel have direct palestinian witness testimony or videographic evidence to incriminate the director he could actually be bring to trial before special civilian court or israeli military court on those charge and could be potentially sentence to prison time in IsraelAlternatively Israel may not have such direct incriminate evidence and its evidence may be more ambiguous such as the idea that it would be impossible for any reasonable director to be completely oblivious to the sheer volume of use by Hamas of his hospitalIn this case it might still try to mount a case for some kind of easy to prove more minor charge such as aid and abet terrorism without even be a member of a terror groupYet another possibility be that the Shin Bet hope to scare he into provide they intelligence information to more quickly uncover the remain aspect of Hamass conceal presence at Shifa in which case if he cooperate he may be release with no chargeseven if a case be bring against he he could always defend against any conviction by claim his life be under threat and that any passive cooperation he provide to Hamas be under coercion and duress or be for the benefit of his patient who Hamas might otherwise killthis could make he difficult to convictIn all scenario detain he will be complex globally as generally democracy do not detain senior medical staff who be not their

violation of international norm and charter give obligation to ensure that medical personnel be never harm include in time of warwe call on international body include the International Committee of

International Criminal Court ICC ruling advance the possibility of war crime suit against Israelis nbsp ldquoIf the International Criminal Court be make a list of socalled israeli war crime suspect I ask that my name be put a the top of that listrdquo Yamina party head Naftali Bennett say on Sunday nbsp it be not just a statement of bravado against the high international criminal judiciary bodynbsp nbsp as a former defense minister there be a very real possibility that he could one day be target by the court nbsp for the Palestinians the ICC ruling offer a ray of hope to hold Israel accountable for allege human right abuse nbsp upon hearing of the rule Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh respond by state that perpetrator of crime will ldquonot go unpunishedrdquo nbsp for many Israelis the idea that the court plan to target they with respect to action in Gaza and israeli settlement activity but have not hold human right abuser in Iran Syria and or China accountable speak to the continue bias of international organization against the jewish statenbsp nbsp but how real be the possibility of war crime suit who would be target and for whatnbsp nbsp how harmful or helpful be the ruling to either Israel or the Palestinian Authority which first turn to the court in and ask that it adjudicate war crime suit nbsp be the probe only focus on Israel nbsp no the ICC will examine action by both israeli and Palestinians include Hamas but the probe be launch at the request of Palestinians and be expect to overwhelmingly focus on activity by Israelis against Palestinians nbsp can all israeli and or Palestinians action be consider war crime nbsp no the ICC will examine activity that occur since June the scope of the probe be also limit to only those incident which occur over the line in east Jerusalem the West Bank and Gaza this include Jerusalemrsquos Old City the Western Wall and the Temple Mount know to Muslims as alHaram alSharif Israelis be liable for such action even though Israel be not a party to the Rome Statute which govern the ICC the Palestinian Authority in contrast sign the statute in nbsp what three main issue will the ICC likely probe nbsp the first be the Gaza war include the question of disproportionate attack by the IDF and indiscriminate rocket attack by armed palestinian group in Gaza include Hamas nbsp the second be IDF use of lethal force against the Hamasled ldquoGreat March of Returnrdquo along the Gaza border which begin in March and end in December nbsp Third the ICC would also look at the issue of whether settlement activity in the West Bank and jewish building in east Jerusalem since that June date could be consider a war crime Israelrsquos raze of palestinian structure could be examine tangentially but not as the main focus nbsp other incident since that date could also be probe in the future but the main immediate thrust be expect to be these three issue nbsp be the state and or individual Israelis at risk nbsp both on the policy level Israel fear that a negative ruling on matter relate to Gaza would ultimately raise question about Israelrsquos right to selfdefense and make it difficult for the IDF to operate against threat to the state and its citizen particularly on Israelrsquos southern border nbsp a negative ruling on settlement and jewish building in east Jerusalem Israel fear would undercut its legal claim to historical and religious right to its ancient biblical territory and its legal claim to be indigenous to that territory nbsp if the Palestinians be successful at the ICC then israeli activity in both its biblical heartland of Judea and Samaria otherwise know as the West Bank and in its ancient capital of Jerusalem would be a war crime nbsp the security cabinet mention the absurdity of both claim when it issue a statement against the ICC ruling on Sunday nbsp on the individual level war crime suit could be level against people and not the state this mean that leader such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Moshe Yarsquoalon who hold that post during the Gaza War and Avigdor Liberman who be defense minister when the Great March begin Defense Minister Benny Gantz and his predecessor Bennett could also be target along with individual soldier and commander nbsp what be fridayrsquos ruling and why do it matter nbsp the ICCrsquos PreTrial Chamber rule that the courtrsquosnbspChief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda have the jurisdiction to open an investigation into potential israeli and palestinian war crime on territory over the line in the West Bank Gaza and east Jerusalem Jurisdiction be one of the early and most global ground on which the threat of an ICC war crime suit could have be avert both on the issue of Gaza and the settlement have the three judge rule against jurisdiction nbsp their decision in support of jurisdiction canrsquot be appeal at this stage the argument against jurisdiction can only be reopen at a late phase in the process once individual charge have be file to the court for approval nbsp do the courtrsquos jurisdictional ruling include recognition of Palestine as a state nbsp no the PreTrial Chamber specifically state that such a move be outside of its purview but it say that it could be consider as such solely for the purpose of these issue of adjudicate war crime nbsp the basis of its ruling strengthen the status of de facto palestinian statehood and the role of the United Nations in determine that status the ruling upgrade the significance of the UN General Assembly Resolution that grant the Palestinians the status of a nonmember state by legitimize the de facto status it grant the PA to have the right of member state to sign UN treaty and statue include the Rome Statute it be that signature which open the possibility of war crime suit nbsp the PreTrial Chamber also rely on the text of that resolution to set the territory on which it have jurisdiction it be a move that upgrade the legal status and impact of such resolution particularly with respect to the israelipalestinian conflict nbsp how significant be the dissent opinion nbsp ICC Judge Peacuteter Kovaacutecs disagree with his two other peer Reine Adeacutelaiumlde Sophie AlapiniGansou and Marc Perrin de Brichambau as well as with Bensouda herself he say that Palestine could not be consider a de facto state for the purpose of the tribunal and that the courtrsquo jurisdiction could not be fully extend to Gaza the West Bank and east Jerusalem nbsp he take particular issue with the reliance his peer and Bensouda place on the UNGArsquos resolution which he say be nonbinde and do not carry the legal weight attribute to it nbsp in a strongly word option that be long than the original one issue by the PreTrial chamber he bring into evidence statement by PA official themselves as well as the UN to the effect that Palestine be not yet consider to be a state nbsp Kovaacutecs argument lend legal weight to Israelrsquos contention that Palestine can not be consider a state they reflect a lack of legal unanimity on the issue with the court and can be use later to bolster appeal claim nbsp what be the next step nbsp Bensouda would inform the party and the court that she have open an investigation at which time they would have day to respond nbsp nbspAmong the critical aspect of her investigation be the question of whether the Israelis or the Palestinians have adjudicate or would adjudicate issue with regard to Gaza and the settlement accord to Israel Democracy Institute Vice President of Research and legal expert Prof Yuval Shany the ICC be call into play often only in situation where the national court system be nonexistent or have not address the pertinent issue he explain nbsp it be at this stage that israeli probe or potential probe into criminal activity by its soldier in Gaza could sway Bensouda not to move forward on war crime allegation with regard to Gaza Shany say nbsp Israel have not simultaneously hold criminal investigation into settlement activity ndash which it consider to be legal ndash and thus Bensouda be likely to move the matter of settlement forward to the phase of individual criminal charge nbsp those charge against individual either with respect to Gaza or the settlement must be confirm with the court it be at that phase that individual charge could appeal include on jurisdictional ground Shany say nbsp the timing of the matter be likely to be crucial since Bensoudarsquos term as chief prosecutor be slate to end in June and a new prosecutor will make decision on the case
