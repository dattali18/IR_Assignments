Fantasia and Variations have the perfect marketing springboard regard the perform artist , debut set , and the hit parade of the time . the original ivory tickler be its composer Mendelssohn and Moscheles , with whom Mendelssohn study for a while . Lev say the venture be destine to get the ticket office roll from the off . & ldquo ; the work be base on a theme by Weber , & rdquo ; Lev explain . the score in question be ride high in the popularity stake of the day . & ldquo ; it be quite a story . in 1833 , Mendelssohn be enjoy the good stage of his career . he be a superstar in England . that be the country where he be most admired . & rdquo ; that PUBLIC profile lead to an offer that be too good to refuse . & ldquo ; his teacher , Ignaz Moscheles , live in London . both be of german jewish origin and the most idolize piano virtuoso in England and Europe . they be the two great jewish virtuosos . & rdquo ; that be also recognize in lofty societal circle . & ldquo ; they be invite to be the key performer in a charity event under the aegis of the royal palace in London . it be a high - brow charity event , & rdquo ; lev note . the organizer seek something that would do justice to the occasion and wow the audience . they choose a prove product and ask the artist to run with it . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; they go for the two big musical celebrity . each perform part of a recital , but the event 's highlight be when they be ask to jointly prepare something base on one of the hit number at that time : Gypsy March , write by Weber for a musical theater production call Preciosa . everyone be mad about Gypsy March . & rdquo ; back in the early 19th century , classical composer and musician frequently allow themselves to stray from the compositional straight and narrow . that suit Mendelssohn and Moscheles down to the ground . & ldquo ; they be ask to improvise variation on this theme , the Gypsy March , & rdquo ; say Lev . & ldquo ; they be both excellent improviser and play like in a jam session ; you take a tune with a chord chart and improvise . & rdquo ; that come across in Fantasia and Variations . & ldquo ; you have one piano play something elaborate while the other play more in line with the chart , and then they switch . it be an open approach . & rdquo ; it work well . & ldquo ; the event be an amazing success , and they ask they to do it again , & rdquo ; lev remark , note that it be not just a matter of reprise the crowd - pleaser . "" they have more time to plan it for the second event . they be both so busy . they decide to turn the improvisation into a write composition . they also add an orchestra . & rdquo ; hence , the format for this week & rsquo ; s Tel Aviv and Jerusalem concert . not that Mendelssohn and moschele be exactly scratch around for work at the time , but , presumably , the response to their effort must have have they rub their hand with anticipation of thrill audience elsewhere . however , as with all good yarn , there be a dramatic twist . & lsquo ; shortly after the second concert , the sheet music disappear , and it be forget . & rdquo ; there be more drama when Mendelssohn die 14 year after the charity event doubleheader , at only 38 . undeterred , his partner in box office success decide to make some hay while the sun still filter through before the memory of the triumph linger . & ldquo ; moschele try to restore the sheet music , & rdquo ; say Lev . that , it transpire , be easy say than do . & ldquo ; in fact , he come up with a different composition . he didn & rsquo ; t really manage to restore the original work . & rdquo ; nevertheless , as they say in certain commercial quarter , you can regain your public profile if you hang around long enough . & ldquo ; suddenly , they discover the original manuscript in archive in Saint Petersburg , of all place , & rdquo ; lev chuckle . that prove to be a game changer . plenty of elbow grease have to be invest before the work could become a practical proposition for public performance . & nbsp ; that be precisely what Lev and his MultiPiano counterpart & ndash ; Berenika Glixman , Nimrod Meity - Haftel , and Lior Lifshitz & ndash ; have do in the past year or so , in London and Berlin and , a couple of week ago , at Carnegie Hall in New York . sheet music be languish in the archive , and it be deplorable , just as the international classical community begin gear up for the bicentennial of Mendelssohn & rsquo ; s birth in 2009 . it be a mess . & ldquo ; there be many thing scribble on the page and many thing add , and the paper be in a bad state , & rdquo ; Lev advise . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; they take expert from the state conservatory in Moscow , with expert in ink and paper . eventually , they have a good copy of the original work 1833 . & rdquo ; all & rsquo ; s well , and that end well . when Lev get wind of the development , he invite the chief restorer of the sheet music to come to Israel to give a talk about the whole process . much to the quartet leader & rsquo ; s surprise and pleasure , the lecturer give he the score after the lecture . lev be determined to grace the work with commensurate respect and revive public interest . that lead to the aforementioned concert worldwide , with the Berlin date film and record , the recording due out soon on the Hyperion label , and a rendition of an intriguing composition by Moscheles . & ldquo ; we be one of the only ensemble in the world to have a copy of the sheet music and to perform it , & rdquo ; lev note proudly . lev : thrill to play the original work in IsraelLev say he be thrilled to be able to play the original work here . & ldquo ; the concert with the ipo close a lovely circle , after concert in London , Berlin , Carnegie Hall in New York , Tel Aviv and Jerusalem . you could see this be a sort of resurrection of the work , bring it back to the surface . the audience have respond amazingly so far . we have have stand ovation everywhere . & rdquo ; there be , surely , more rapturous applause due for the ensemble and ipo when they present Fantasia and Variations here . and Levanon should rightly be well receive , too . his composition feed off the sound , rhythm , and sensibility of four culture that the Romanian - bear composer consider to be core to the State of Israel & mdash ; Hebrew , yiddish , Arabic , and Ladino . Levanon write the piece for MultiPiano , which perform work on two piano for four , six , or eight hand , with or without an orchestra . lev believe the time be particularly ripe for the work to resound from the concert hall and , hopefully , change mindset & ndash ; and possibly make some difference to the dismal state of regional affair . & ldquo ; when we start tour internationally with MultiPiano , we see that people don & rsquo ; t know about Israel & rsquo ; s multiculturalism . so we decide we want to perform something that would reflect the pluralist face of this country . & rdquo ; Levanon be up for that . & ldquo ; he compose Land of Four Languages . he choose four traditional tune in different language . his message be that if the four can live together harmoniously , in the score , maybe they will learn to live together in the real world . & rdquo ; the composition have be well receive thus far , but in the wake of October 7 , Lev feel the cross - cultural creation have take on add significance . & ldquo ; after Levanon & rsquo ; s pass , and after everything Israel have be through in the past few month , the value and message of this work be more relevant than ever . & rdquo ; for ticket and more information : https : / / www . ipo . co . il / en /",'loved but not lost': piano ensemble presents new classical music restored
"this week , a number of voice , many of they link to Israel & rsquo ; s former rule Likud Party , claim that the Mughrabi bridge , which link the Temple Mount to an area near the Western Wall and be use by non - Muslims to visit the Temple Mount , be in danger of collapse . former transportation minister MK Miri Regev say & ldquo ; it be forbid to wait another moment with the demolition of the bridge and the construction of an appropriate replacement . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; the concern about the bridge ostensibly date from a month ago when an engineer & rsquo ; s report say that the wood the bridge be construct with do not enable safe use of the bridge . this raise question about why the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu didn & rsquo ; t replace or reinforce the bridge recently , despite be in office for a decade . how do a bridge suddenly become unsafe around the same time Israel get a new government ? why be there now a new potential crisis at the sensitive holy site ? do the crisis emerge precisely when the Kingdom of Jordan and Israel be work to repair tie ? Jordan be sensitive to any change to the status quo and previous attempt to alter the bridge have meet with protest and also conspiracy spread about al - Aqsa be in danger . these kind of conspiracy have lead to conflict in the past , include the recent Gaza war . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; so how do we get here ? in 2011 , a temporary structure , often call the Mughrabi bridge after an early ramp and neighborhood that once exist underneath the temporary bridge , be close due to safety concern . at the time , report say that & ldquo ; official close the Mugrabi Bridge on Sunday , three day before the municipality deadline to close the ramp lead from the Western Wall plaza to the Temple Mount . the Jerusalem city engineer , Shlomo Eshkol , have warn over the past year in a series of letter to the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation & ndash ; which oversee the area & ndash ; that the temporary bridge be unsafe . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; let & rsquo ; s recall what happen at the time , 10 year ago . & ldquo ; the municipality originally set November 28 , 2011 as the deadline to destroy the bridge , but . . . Netanyahu intervene to stop the demolition , worry about trigger riot across the arab world . in the most recent letter , send last week , the municipality insist the entrance must be close to the public until a new bridge be build . & rdquo ; Netanyahu choose to cancel the demolition of the bridge because of concern in Egypt and Jordan . the Jerusalem Municipality try to close the structure on December 12 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; oddly the issue then disappear from the headline . somehow , the unsafe bridge continue to exist with some modification . in 2014 , a new report emerge . a new part of the bridge have be add . & ldquo ; Erected less than two week ago , the bridge have not officially be open when . . . Netanyahu order it be dismantle after it become clear that the project be not approve by the relevant authority , and amid mount jordanian protest . & rdquo ; once again , the temporary bridge , erect after the ramp collapse partially in 2004 , have become permanent and any change be see as a & ldquo ; status quo & rdquo ; issue threaten peace in the region . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; it appear that in 2011 and 2014 the Netanyahu government choose to forego change in order to maintain calm . now , suddenly , there be call to remove the bridge by member of the same party that didn & rsquo ; t remove it for a decade . this , despite the fact that it be well know that previous change have always result in a crisis . be this controversy about the bridge or create stumble block for the new government in tie with Jordan ? Jordan & rsquo ; s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi have meet his israeli counterpart in what the Jordan Times call a & ldquo ; semblance of normality . & rdquo ; there be a new deal to supply Jordan with water . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett have be outspoken on the importance of tie with Jordan . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; for Netanyahu , the Kingdom of Jordan be always a sour point . he run into many controversy with the kingdom date back to his time in office in the 1990 . Netanyahu didn & rsquo ; t make progress on the plan to develop the Arava peace valley with Jordan , and Jordan harshly slam Israel during the 25 - year anniversary of the peace agreement between the country , demand Israel return land that be part of the agreement . in 2017 , an incident with an israeli security guard in Jordan , in which two Jordanians be kill , lead to another crisis . most recently , Netanyahu cancel a short trip to the UAE on the eve of election after a stop in Jordan apparently be nix . in addition Jordan & rsquo ; s crown prince cancel a trip to Jerusalem in March . relation be at their low point in memory . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Netanyahu have slam Jordan in recent day , critique the water deal and accuse Jordan of have tie to Iran . the insinuation be that Jordan have transport oil from Iraq to Egypt and that somehow , this help Iran . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; it be in this context that there be rise call for the government to make change to the Mughrabi bridge . any chance be likely to cause a crisis . close the bridge would anger some of the Jews who visit the Temple Mount weekly . it would also mean non - Muslims could not visit the historic area near the mosque and Dome of the Rock . any change to the bridge would lead to complaint from Jordan unless there be coordination . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; there be no doubt the bridge need to be safe , both for those who use it and because it stretch over a part of the woman & rsquo ; s section of the Western Wall . there be many question to be ask why this bridge issue be never responsibly address for more than a decade . it appear convenient that suddenly those who be in office for many year and make no change now want it close , demolish , change or remove . like many thing that take place over the last decade in Israel where problem be manage , or what some call & ldquo ; mow the grass , & rdquo ; be do to postpone address major issue . the bridge be a symbol of how Jerusalem and Israel be manage . this crisis management mean postpone many major problem , such as deal with Gaza & rsquo ; s constant crisis , to the issue face Bedouin in the Negev , to ignore the crowding at Meron that lead to a disaster , and then not investigate it . the current government want to address the issue , but stoke up issue like the Mughrabi bridge appear to be a way to create a crisis with Jordan precisely when Jordan and Israel be keen on work together again . whether the kingdom might be interested in be flexible regard the bridge might be address , but such status quo issue usually take time and be sensitive because of the position of the Palestinians and the Wakf and other authority and stakeholder . the King of Jordan be meet the US president on July 19 . perhaps responsible policy regard the bridge will prevail . & nbsp ; & nbsp ;",is jerusalem’s mughrabi bridge in news to spark jordan crisis? - analysis

Police initially arrest six Israelis and one palestinian in connection with the September 28 event . in an unusual move OC Central Command Maj . - Gen . Yehuda Fox visit al - Mufaqarah last week and speak with Mahmoud Hamamdeh to learn firsthand about the incident . Palestinians , include Mahmoud , say that from their perspective the incident could not have occur without the army , which they say be on the scene almost from the start . the village of al - Mufaqarah be close to the scene of a September 17 incident in which an IDF major and his unit prevent a group of left - wing activist from reach a small palestinian hamlet near the Avigail outpost so as to deliver a truckload of water . the soldier be capture on film use what appear to be undue force to dispel the activist , who have be march on both side of a narrow paved road that lead to the outpost and that also pass by Khirbet al - Mufaqarah .

Israel have carry out more than 1 , 000 airstrike against iranian target in Syria , accord to January 2019 report . that number be likely close to 1 , 500 airstrike by now . the US carry out retaliatory airstrike against Iranian - back force in Syria in December 2019 after an attack that kill a contractor at K - 1 base in Iraq . & nbsp ; in January , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledge US intelligence support for israeli airstrike in Syria , accord to Al - Monitor , a Washington - base news website . can the US force Iran out of Syria , ponder Jared Szuba in a piece at Al - Monitor last December . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; be we ever go to get to a place where Iran do not have force in Syria ? & rdquo ; Michael Mulroy , a former US deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East , ask during a think - tank event on December 17 , the report note . & ldquo ; I mean , people that be smart on this than I have tell I , no , that & rsquo ; s not go to happen . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Mulroy , a veteran CIA paramilitary officer who work on Syria during his time at the Pentagon , suggest that minimize Tehran & rsquo ; s influence in the Levant should remain a US goal , & rdquo ; Szuba write . & ldquo ; & lsquo ; maybe we should have a smart take to it , & rsquo ; he add . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; it be know that the US under the previous administration , include national security advisor John Bolton and secretary of state Mike Pompeo , seek to support Israel & rsquo ; s action regard Iran & rsquo ; s entrenchment in Syria . & nbsp ; Iran rapidly increase entrenchment since 2018 , and Iran & rsquo ; s force have suffer accordingly . a strike in June 2018 hit a KH headquarters in Albukamal . iraqi medium at the time , report statement by the pro - iranian Hashd al - Shaabi , blame the US and Israel for the strike . & nbsp ; in an interview in January , former US Syria envoy James Jeffrey showcase how Israel and the US be work together in Syria . in Foreign Affairs , the former american envoy on syrian policy say : & ldquo ; US - support israeli strike on iranian target in the country far limit the [ syrian ] regime & rsquo ; s military option . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Jeffrey also tell Szuba in an interview for Al - Monitor about the US support for israeli airstrike in Syria . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the US only begin support that when I come on board , & rdquo ; he say . & ldquo ; I go out there and we see Prime Minister [ Benjamin ] Netanyahu and other , and they think that they be not be support enough by the US military , and not by intelligence . and there be a big battle within the US government , and we win the battle . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the argument [ against support Israel & rsquo ; s campaign ] be , again , this obsession with the counterterrorism mission . People didn & rsquo ; t want to screw with it , either by worry about Turkey or divert resource to allow the Israelis to muck around in Syria , as maybe that will lead to some blowback to our force . it hasn & rsquo ; t . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; support Israel in Syria be a pillar of US policy on Syria . & nbsp ; the changeover in US administration in January lead to many question about whether the US would continue to support Israel & rsquo ; s freedom of action in Syria and also whether the US would respond to iranian attack . now we know that the support appear to be continue and that both Israel and the US be willing to strike Iranian - back force or threat in Syria . & nbsp ; link Syria to Iran & rsquo ; s attack elsewhere be a key aspect of the strike over the last several day . that mean Iran may be get a message that if it do something in the Gulf of Oman , its militia could be target 2 , 000 kilometer away . the US appear to have say the same thing . & nbsp ; the idea that the militia unit in Syria be responsible for guide policy that target a ship in the Gulf of Oman or strike at a sensitive location in Erbil appear overwrought . it be the linkage and messaging and context of US support for israeli action in Syria that be important . & nbsp ; David Shor , who commentate on regional issue , note on Twitter in a thread on the attack : & ldquo ; Time will tell before we can ascertain precisely what be attack tonight in Syria , and whether these target can be differentiate at all from the hundred of other target over the year in Syria . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; that be a key point , beyond the linkage , of what the strike have hit and whether this matter to Iran . & nbsp ; Airstrikes have long be part of a large Clausewitz - style , air - power diplomacy in the region , whereby an action in one place result in a reaction in another . & nbsp ; for instance , Iran be establish a permanent military base in Syria at Al - Kiswah , a & ldquo ; western intelligence source & rdquo ; tell the BBC in November 2017 . Al - Kiswah have be strike several time since then , in May 2018 , June 2019 and in January 2021 . & nbsp ; Airstrikes in eastern Syria on Iranian - link target be carry out by Israel with intelligence provide by the US , a senior US intelligence official say this January . & nbsp ; there be now a long timeline from the Kiswah revelation in November 2017 , the warning about iranian entrenchment in 2017 and 2018 , the increase entrenchment , the strike on the Hezbollah killer - drone team near the Golan Heights in August 2019 and then the revelation of increase US support for Israel & rsquo ; s action in 2020 , as well as US airstrike against iranian element in Syria in 2019 and now in 2021 . & nbsp ; the map of Israel - US involvement in Syria be grow and converge on Iran & rsquo ; s network of basis in the region , which stretch across its plethora of proxy force from Iraq to Lebanon . this may pave the way for increase US - Israel cooperation in the region , or at least underpin a share strategy .",israel-us attacks against iran in syria pave way for increased cooperation

"the current campaign between Israel and Hamas be the fierce one since the 2014 war . it should end because of several reason . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s Iron Dome be successful in intercept rocket , but as the campaign continue , the chance that one or several rocket will cause heavy israeli casualty rapidly increase . a significant blow , harm dozen of Israelis , might push Israel to launch a large - scale ground offensive , deep inside the Gaza Strip . such an attack might seek to defeat Hamas once and for all , but topple its rule would likely force Israel into the position of conquer the Strip altogether , an outcome Israel do not ultimately desire . & nbsp ; the Gaza Strip be a small area ( 365 square kilometer ) , and it have be highly monitor by Israel , make it easy for the IDF to gather vital information about Hamas and other group there . the IDF also have be train to confront Hamas . nevertheless , in retake the Gaza Strip , hundred of israeli troop will be kill or injure , fight their foe above and underground . & nbsp ; Hamas dig long tunnel in the Gaza Strip , prepare itself for war , include as part of an IDF territorial seizure . the fight would therefore not be over after the IDF capture the entire Gaza Strip . the IDF would have to destroy the exist military infrastructure . palestinian combatant , not only from Hamas , would aspire to harm Israelis , include take they as prisoner . Israelis in the Gaza Strip would inevitably be target for ambush , ied , etc . & nbsp ; as in prior similar campaign , Israel have rely on firepower , mostly through aircraft , to make significant achievement . however , these accomplishment fall short of the chance for complete victory . since Israel will not retake the Gaza Strip , Hamas will keep its base , recover and produce additional and more sophisticated rocket and missile with long range , accuracy etc . follow israeli strike , Hamas might need month , and in certain area , year to rebuild its strength . Hamas , include its naval commando , be hit hard . overall , Israel manage to inflict Hamas quite a blow in this round . & nbsp ; Israel theorize that more strike in the current round will be adequate to cripple the military wing of Hamas , delay another round , but there be no guarantee of that . Hamas will still have a capability to challenge Israel . & nbsp ; this round start follow clash in Jerusalem , which be capable of occur again at any time for a variety of reason . Israel need to be careful in this matter , but predict in advance what will ignite riot , let alone another round with Hamas , be a speculative undertaking . the latter can easily rely on friction between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem as an excuse for strike Israel , produce yet another extended campaign . & nbsp ; Hamas be an iranian proxy , although independent in many respect . its self - determination have be demonstrate in several instance , such as when it refuse to fight for Assad , Iran & rsquo ; s ally , during the syrian civil war . nevertheless , Iran recognize the importance of Hamas due to its location , near Israel , and since it be sunni . the mostly Shi & rsquo ; ite Iran use this religious factor to present itself as one that assist Sunnis , and not only Shi & rsquo ; ite group such as Hezbollah . & nbsp ; in recent year , iranian training and knowledge help Hamas upgrade its missile and rocket , with the result be show in this late round . Iran hereby hit Israel indirectly , as part of the ongoing conflict between they . Israel return the favor by bomb iranian target inside Syria , and by conduct covert operation against Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s most crucial national security concern be stop or at least delay the development of Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . it be a top priority for Israel , more important than any issue Israel have with Hamas or any other national security concern for that matter . & nbsp ; talk between Iran , the United States , and other power about contain Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program be ongoing . Israel do not have much leverage in those negotiation , but as long as Israel be occupy with Hamas , Israel can not focus on what matter most : handle Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . in that sense , Hamas serve Iran even if Hamas fight Israel for its own reason . this be another major reason why Israel should end the current campaign with Hamas . & nbsp ; Israel and the United States have close tie , but the Biden administration do not have very friendly relation with the israeli government . Israel need its american patron in order to reach the good outcome for the current round with Hamas . Israel rely much more on the United States to make sure the talk with Iran will be effective at restrain Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . & nbsp ; if Israel annoy the Biden administration with respect to the Gaza Strip , the United States might be less willing to listen to Israel about Iran . the Biden administration lend Israel time in fight Hamas but it be clear the Biden administration want this campaign to subside . if Israel insist on persist with this round , it risk increase friction with the Biden administration . the Gaza Strip have be under the rule of Hamas since 2007 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Hamas , due to its mismanagement and eagerness to confront Israel , cause a deep economic and social crisis in the Gaza Strip . some predict that this area might collapse , drive thousand of desperate Palestinians to infiltrate Israel and ask for help . obviously , Israel do not prefer this outcome . if Israel continue with this round , the probability of further decline in the Gaza Strip increase . & nbsp ; many arab state oppose Hamas , and some , like those in the Gulf , have tie with Israel . arab state can & rsquo ; t openly support Israel in this round , fear public opinion inside their country and across the arab world . arab criticism of Israel be not as pronounce as it use to be , but this can easily change for the bad . the long this round be continue , the high the burden of casualty amongst the palestinian population will reach , force even arab state that have normalize relation with Israel , to speak and maybe even to act against Israel . & nbsp ; all in all , end the current campaign will frustrate many in Israel who wish to defeat Hamas . however , Israel should cut its loss , and not extend this campaign , because it be simply not worth the cost and the risk . & nbsp ; Dr .

"some see the world in one or two dimension and other in three . when Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , who also have a portfolio within the Defense Ministry , respond to the palestinian terrorist attack in which two Jews be murder in Huwara in the northern West Bank by call for use tank and helicopter against the Palestinians , he certainly be not think three - dimensionally . nor be National Security Minister Itamar Ben - Gvir , who pick a fight with the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , which recommend unseal the residence of a terrorist who kill three Jews early in February . these view be indicative of narrow thinking . lesson from the Second Intifada and the Knife Intifada show that substantially increase IDF physical presence in West Bank area , especially palestinian area , be part of the necessary mix of ingredient for restore calm and security . but that presence rarely involve tank and helicopter & ndash ; blunt instrument for open battlefield or for target large , concentrated enemy position . those position do not exist in the West Bank , which do not have the massive volume of rocket , other destructive weapon and well - structure Hamas militia that exist in Gaza . why will not tank , helicopter in the West Bank secure quiet with the Palestinians ? the Palestinian Authority , while it might not control all area and might be turn a blind eye to terrorist element , be actively avoid conflict with the IDF . Non - PA terrorist element do not pose anywhere near the same magnitude of threat as Hamas . neither do they present a useful large target for tank or helicopter . militarily , the tactic that work before , and would likely work now if it need to be unleash , would involve huge number of soldier go door to door , with intelligence support from drone . likewise , despite Ben - Gvir & rsquo ; s attack on the Shin Bet , the security agency have be a big supporter of house demolition to deter future terrorism . however , part of the Shin Bet & rsquo ; s rationale be that Palestinians know in their heart of heart that the agency be focus on family who hold some joint responsibility for the terrorism of their family member . in contrast , the Shin Bet find that the Ramot terrorist from early this month be psychologically unstable and that the family do not assist he in any way and might even have try to temper his violent leaning . a house demolition in that case could just create more terrorist , even accord to the Shin Bet , because not a single palestinian would see it as legitimate . but the Second Intifada be also bring under control by the eventual completion of the West Bank security barrier to limit infiltration . one problem in a dimension where use force can not solve everything & ndash ; and tank and helicopter be useless and impractical to police a long border & ndash ; be that , as IDF source tell the Jerusalem Post , complete those portion of the barrier where Palestinians be still sneak through into sovereign Israel could take another 18 month . and this doesn & rsquo ; t even address east Jerusalem , where there be not any initiative be entertain that could handle the security situation . arab from east Jerusalem travel freely in Israel . even presume that nearly all of they aren & rsquo ; t look to act against Israel , anyone with violent intention be unrestrained . tank and helicopter be even less relevant there . Sunday & rsquo ; s terrorist attack occur in an overlap palestinian area , where Palestinians and Israelis mix , the least secure type of location . the Knife Intifada be partially put down by israeli security force use social medium and drone surveillance to predict and prevent terrorist attack by & ldquo ; lone wolf & rdquo ; attacker before they happen . yet , many say another ingredient to end the Second Intifada be Israel & rsquo ; s announce withdrawal from Gaza . in contrast , there be currently no diplomatic dimension ( or & ldquo ; carrot & rdquo ; ) on the table from Israel to follow a new Operation Defensive Shield ( or & ldquo ; stick & rdquo ; ) , such as then - prime minister Ariel Sharon use . in parallel to demolish more house , take away terrorist & rsquo ; citizenship and call for capital punishment for terrorist , the current government be also in negotiation with the PA , Jordan and Egypt to try to calm the broad situation before it transform into another intifada . part of the & ldquo ; deal & rdquo ; that seem to have emerge include freeze unilateral action on both side for some month . for Israel , this refer to new settlement and outpost , whereas for the Palestinians , it might have refer to legal move against Israel in the UN system . but as those effort continue , element of the coalition oppose any dialogue whatsoever with any Palestinians , even though the Shin Bet believe dialogue be critical to restore security cooperation with the PA . in past year , some intelligence official tell the Post that the PA have help Israel stop 20 % or more of terrorist attack against Israel & ndash ; not insignificant number . and tank and helicopter in the West Bank would not make thing quieter with Hamas in Gaza . to date , the current government have fail to convince Hamas to fully disconnect itself from issue with Palestinians in other conflict area . all of this come down to the idea that use force , and more of it , may absolutely be part of the equation to end the almost yearlong up - and - down current wave of violence . but there will also likely need to be a & ldquo ; carrot & rdquo ; in there somewhere , whether economic , diplomatic or both . might the new deal be enough in this area , or be it inadequate to escape the current quagmire ? other ingredient could be the unfinished security barrier in the West Bank , which will take time , come up with a unique security solution to east Jerusalem security issue and figure out a way to restore deterrence with Hamas in Gaza . this would mean the current government will need to try some new and creative idea on multiple playing field instead of only double down with populist slogan in one dimension . there be many idea , short of a messianic peace vision , that can help restore calm , and the late deal might help with that . but tank and helicopter be either a tiny part or a nonexistent part of the solution .","could tanks, helicopters secure quiet in w. bank with palestinians? - analysis"

Police be a tiny part in this giant story of Bedouin settlement in the Negev ; talk about [ how the ] police [ should intervene ] give good headline , but it be not the story . & rdquo ; in November , the Knesset & rsquo ; s Research and Information Center publish a staggering report show that the high crime rate in the country be in the South . & ldquo ; our bad fear be that the State of Israel create a state within a state . they don & rsquo ; t pay taxis , they don & rsquo ; t have proper address ; people be live off the grid and be not accountable under the law , & rdquo ; say Kahn . on a tour in the area in December , Bennett proclaim : & ldquo ; the law of Beersheba and Rahat be like the law of Tel Aviv . we will continue to act until we restore the sense of security to the resident of the South . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; the Bedouin community be on the low socioeconomic rung in Israel , Kahn say , with there be gap in education and in infrastructure . & ldquo ; these be thing they have a legal right to as citizen of Israel , but the money that the government invest in the Bedouin sector be getting lose along the way . & rdquo ; when Bennett go south , he meet with Beersheba Mayor Ruvik Danilovich , who deliver a clear message : strong governance be need in the Negev to begin to regulate Bedouin settlement . Danilovich be one of the only town leader Bennett meet with on his tour , catch flak for only go to an observation point that overlook Rahat and not enter the city itself . Faiz Abu Sahiban , mayor of the large Bedouin city and the second - large arab city in Israel , call the trip an insult . & ldquo ; Rahat be a city well inside the border of Israel , not outside of it . the itinerary of the tour be problematic and disgusting in how it treat a city that be in the heart of the state as a threat . & rdquo ; what would happen if the state intervene ? & ldquo ; [ we would have ] a completely protect minority that can live fully under the law and protect their own culture , & rdquo ; Regavim say . in Regavim & rsquo ; s eye , there be two step that be necessary to take to ensure stability in the region : put people on the map & ndash ; make sure that everyone be register to a real address , for accountability and tracking & ndash ; and resolve land ownership dispute . in October , Bennett & rsquo ; s government be threaten over a bill introduce by Ra & rsquo ; be ( United Arab List ) , later pass in the plenum as the electricity law . the law allow thousand of illegally build home to be hook up to the national electricity grid . & ldquo ; the government wake up and realize that 300 , 000 Bedouin be live here [ without proper infrastructure ] and that this be a tick time bomb . so , the government start to change its tune , & rdquo ; the police say . Beersheba be the fast grow city in Israel , but it can & rsquo ; t grow because of the illegal encampment surround it . if that be the case , & ldquo ; we & rsquo ; re finish , & rdquo ; Regavim & rsquo ; s Kahn say . accord to the Israel Police , a solution could be find by take the right approach in the dispute between the two culture & ndash ; western - israeli and Bedouin . & ldquo ; anyone who try to understand the Bedouin culture with western eye will fail , & rdquo ; it say . ■",israel's bedouin: what is the truth behind the crime-ridden headlines?

"two of Israel & rsquo ; s top international law official have publish a rare public article to challenge the International Criminal Court prosecution and other who say that Israel still illegally occupy Gaza . the article , publish in the journal Iyunei Mishpat ( Legal Studies ) recently but be report now for the first time in English , be important both regard address case of alleged israeli war crime in ongoing fighting with Hamas , as well as regard what humanitarian obligation Jerusalem have to Gaza , during coronavirus and other period . these issue ultimately have major long - term implication at the national security and diplomatic level , include whether Israel & rsquo ; s naval blockade and other periodic closure of Gaza be legal . just as important be the author : Deputy Attorney - General ( International Law ) Roy Schondorf and IDF International Law Division chief Col . Eran Shamir - Borer , two official who have lead much of Israel & rsquo ; s handling of ICC issue and humanitarian dilemma with Gaza . Schondorf rarely write publicly or appear in public with the exception of specific conference or at the Knesset , and Shamir - Borer appear even less often . it seem that the impetus for their article be to address prior statement by ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda as well as a current article by prominent israeli prof . Eyal Gross in the same journal , declare that Israel still legally occupy Gaza , despite having withdraw in 2005 . if Bensouda , Gross and a number of israeli critic in UN and international body be correct that Israel occupy Gaza , it could mean that the jewish state might be restrict in what category of force it could use to combat Hamas attack , let alone protest or riot on the border . far , it could mean that any humanitarian crisis in Gaza put Israel at fault . when there be debate about israeli blockade to prevent rocket and other weapon smuggling , these legal question could have a decisive impact . essentially , Bensouda , Gross and much of the international community say that it be irrelevant that the IDF withdraw and that Israel withdraw its settlement from within the Gaza Strip . rather , they argue that UN General Assembly decision , International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) guidance , a decision by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) and other point prove that Israel can & ldquo ; occupy & rdquo ; Gaza as long as it exert functional control . to support their argument , they note that Israel control Gaza & rsquo ; s airspace , maritime border , wherever there be a blockade , and most of its land border . Gaza do have one border crossing with Egypt . they broaden these argument by say that Israel & rsquo ; s ability to control Gaza & rsquo ; s interaction with the outside world mean it can also control the economic and humanitarian situation there . in this light , they say that Israel be also obligate to maintain Gaza from a humanitarian perspective , whether with special need during coronavirus time or with sufficient medical , food , utility and other item during more normal period . in CONTRAST , Schondorf and Shamir - Bohrer say that there be no basis to rely on the decision of the UN General Assembly or other political body to decide international law . regard the icty decision , they say that critic & rsquo ; understanding of the decision be misplace . in the icty case in question , the court be deal with a situation where a foreign state control an internal group within another state in order to impose its will on the other state . in any event , the israeli official & rsquo ; article say that the icty decision be an outlier create a new doctrine which no one else have adopt . moreover , the article say that the idea israeli critic be bring to the Gaza question be & ldquo ; wishful thinking & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; aspiration & rdquo ; to create a new law which do not exist . instead , they say that to be consider an & ldquo ; occupi , & rdquo ; a country can not merely have aspect of functional power over a territory . rather , it must have at a minimum & ldquo ; effective control . & rdquo ; this traditionally have require boot on the ground and , at the very least , involvement in run the day - to - day affair of the foreign territory and population . as the article say , Israel have zero involvement in run Gaza & rsquo ; s day - to - day affair , which be run by Hamas . far , the article cite a legal brief file by Germany in the Israel - palestinian proceeding before the ICC to support its view . all of this mean that Israel have not occupy Gaza since 2005 . rather , when Israel facilitate food , economic and medical aid to Gaza , it be on a voluntary humanitarian basis and balance along with valid security consideration , say the article . in December 2019 , Bensouda request that the ICC Pretrial Chamber endorse by March her desire to conduct a full criminal probe of Israel and Hamas regard the 2014 Gaza War , the 2018 Gaza border crisis and the settlement enterprise . the chamber have still not decide the issue , with the question remain whether it will decide after US President - elect Joe Biden take office or wait for Bensouda & rsquo ; s successor to take over in June 2021 .",israel’s 2 top int’l law officials take on icc: is gaza ‘occupied’?
"woman have be present in the israeli art scene from its beginning & ndash ; artist such as Aviva Uri , Esther Peretz Arad , Anna Ticho , Leah Nikel , and Ruth Shlos . their role in build the art world in Israel seem to I as significant as the impact of female pioneer ( halutzot ) in create the State of Israel , the role of the first female prime minister , Golda Meir , and ( up to the present day ) the importance of female soldier serve in the IDF . however , even though the role of woman have be so crucial in Israel , and the feminist art movement be not as strong as in other country , it take female artist decade to be equally represent by gallery and museum . Ruth Markus be a retire lecturer in Tel Aviv University & rsquo ; s history of Art Department and founder of the Association for Women & rsquo ; s Art and Gender Research in Israel . in her article & ldquo ; artist : Yishuv and Israel : 1920 - 1970 & rdquo ; in the Shalvi / Hyman Encyclopedia of jewish Women , she say that it be only since the 1990s that & ldquo ; the number of participant in exhibition in the various museum and gallery be divide equally between man and woman , with the woman at time even in the majority . & rdquo ; today , I even dare to say that woman dominate israeli art . therefore , especially on International Women & rsquo ; s day , I & rsquo ; ve choose for the Magazine three woman artist who , even during the war , be constantly active . they agree to answer my three question : what inspire you ? what do you call art ? what , in your opinion , make your artwork different from that of other artist ? Batia ShaniBatia Shani be a multimedia artist , emphasize embroidery , mail art , painting , and collage . she be the mother of three and grandmother of six . she use material and clothe previously use , include idf uniform . shani embroider text , image , number , and amorphic shape . each of the garment hold image and word ; for example , the name and age of woman murder by their partner . her art deal with social issue , violence against woman and family , people in crisis , refugee , and recently , the painful silence toward the sexual victim of the Oct . 7 massacre . in her late work , it be embroider : & ldquo ; I too . unless you & rsquo ; re a Jew . & rdquo ; bear and raise in Haifa to a family of Holocaust survivor who come to Israel just after WW II , Shani be expect to get an education and start a & ldquo ; normal job . & rdquo ; so , before become an artist , she work as a social worker . art be always present in her life , but it be only in her mid - thirty that she decide to focus completely on art , study at the Royal School of Needlework in London , and later in Israel at the Hamidrasha School of Art , Beit Berl College , Kalmania . & ldquo ; the study help I understand that embroidery be my language , & rdquo ; she say . embroidery as a craft be deeply rooted in her family tradition . when she be a girl , she watch her aunt embroider . she change it into art . since the 1990 , Shani have exhibit her work at many art fair , gallery , and museum around the world . now she be prepare two solo exhibition . & ldquo ; I speak Gibberish to you & rdquo ; be set to open on May 9 in her studio at 6 Hapelech Street in Tel Aviv . a show at the University of Haifa ( name not yet reveal ) will open on June 2 . inspiration : everything . in general , my work be improvise ; I don & rsquo ; t have any plan when I start my journey with my needle [ there be a dress full of story that she work on for a year ] . my inspiration come from the piece of fabric that I start to work with , but it must be material with some history . in many of my work , I want to preserve the memory of my late mother . I be inspire by my emotion and by what I see around I . for example , in my upcoming exhibition , I will reflect on the situation in Israel . I feel a lack of word to express what be happen in Israel [ last year ] , so I use embroidery as & lsquo ; gibberish & rsquo ; language . I think it be the bad moment in my country : I didn & rsquo ; t realize it could get much bad . . . meaning of art : for I , as a viewer & ndash ; because I love see art by other & ndash ; it be something that touch I . of course , it come through the door of visuality , but [ it have to be ] something that will play on my emotional thread . SHANI & rsquo ; S ARTWORK : first of all , I refuse to look for something unique , something that be only mine . but , of course , it make I very happy when someone recognize my embroidery and envelope & ndash ; which be also characteristic in my work ; these be my fingerprint . I think maybe the amount of sensitivity to the detail , maybe my ability to express sad and painful thing be what make my work different . I be a feminist artist , so I show thing that cause the discrimination of woman . I try not to put , as a headline , that my work be politically involved , but I have a lot to say about politic . I be deal with catastrophe , with grief . the current war . . . the outcome be very aesthetic , often very colorful , but when people come close to it , they notice the text that I embroider , which be very hard . batiashani . com / Noa YekutieliAt a young age , Noa Yekutieli be already an internationally accomplished artist . for over a decade she have have various solo show and participate in group exhibition all over the world . her work be in the collection of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem , the Tel Aviv Museum of Art , and various private collection . she live and work in Tel Aviv , Los Angeles , and New York . her solo exhibition & ldquo ; no long & ndash ; not yet & rdquo ; be currently on view at Brooklyn & rsquo ; s International Studio & amp ; Curatorial Program ( ISCP ) through June 21 . in April , she will participate in a group exhibition & ldquo ; Common Ground : israeli Art meet Archaeology & rdquo ; at the Israel Museum . Yekutieli come from a multicultural family ( japanese - american - israeli ) and use her rich heritage in her work . she combine a diversity of material that , she say , & ldquo ; echo longing for unknown singular origin and fractured notion of home . & rdquo ; she engage in various medium , such as installation , assemblage , and her signature manual paper - cut technique , about which , she say , & ldquo ; it mirror my artistic essence . it embody the japanese concept of & lsquo ; Ma & rsquo ; & ndash ; emphasize the significance of miss or what be miss . I be draw to the unseen , reflect overlooked narrative and the complexity of cultural assimilation . the act of its irreversibility reduction mirror life , leave scar that prompt reflection . & rdquo ; inspiration : as a multicultural artist of japanese - american - israeli background , I naturally seek to bridge between culture and language in my work . I be inspire to explore new language or form of expression to address traumatic and complex subject such as the social - political reality in Israel - Palestine , immigration , and cyclic pattern of destruction . & nbsp ; through the medium of manual cut paper , I be compel to create space and artwork imbue with a deliberately contrast aesthetic . I attempt to offer an alternative language & ndash ; one that be more vulnerable , feminine , and nuance & ndash ; in observe and reflect on the harsh reality we confront . this counter the rapid pace and predominantly western , masculine discourse that often create this reality , to begin with , and be perpetuate the continuous destructive pattern . I be inspire to create space that can hold more than one narrative , more than one absolute truth & ndash ; to question how we tell story rather than tell a story . meaning of art : to I , art encompass any endeavor that challenge what we often accept as & lsquo ; the nature of thing & rsquo ; or & lsquo ; establish perspective . & rsquo ; it & rsquo ; s not about resistance for its own sake but rather about suggest and provide fresh viewpoint to comprehend the reality surround we . art act as a bubble within which I can uniquely unfold the intricacy of reality , and then reconnect with the broad world through my art again . it serve as a meditative space where my unconscious take over , lead I to different way of think about the give . YEKUTIELI & rsquo ; S ARTWORK : in my perspective , what set my artwork apart be that I be not afraid of embrace liminal space . often , there & rsquo ; s a reluctance to engage with these space of in - betweenness : those that be almost , not here nor there , or unclear , even though they constitute much of our live experience . in my practice , I be deeply intrigue by the notion of craft environment where we collectively explore liminality , view it not as a mere interim state await conclusion but as a novel and fertile terrain in its own right . & nbsp ; come from a multicultural background devoid of a historically share past & ndash ; be both japanese and israeli & ndash ; I find myself naturally attune to multiplicity without experience discomfort . in a world mark by polarization , I see the creation of space , where multiplicity enriche rather than confuse , as a crucial aspect of the human experience . www . noayekutieli . com / Ella TaubA self - teach artist , Ella Taub & ndash ; in her sculpture , painting , relief work , print , and drawing & ndash ; focus on the nature of change in a feminine body , also oscillate between historically appreciate shape and contemporary beauty image . Taub explore different female role in her art and the evolution of self - image . Taub work with different material , sometimes include body - like one , and metal chain . & ldquo ; I collect material for my work from my surrounding ; each of my work be connect to the place and time in which I create . often , a material from which the sculpture emerge give the work & rsquo ; s narrative , & rdquo ; she tell the Magazine . some of her work be very personal and base on intimate relation with herself and other . in her recent February solo show in Tel Aviv & ldquo ; what I Didn & rsquo ; t Wear , & rdquo ; Taub refer to her close connection with her mother ( with whom , at age five , she make aliyah from St . Petersburg , Russia ) but also enter into a dialogue with her future daughter , whom she might have one day . Taub have exhibit in Israel and Berlin . her work be on view until March 9 at the group show & ldquo ; Bread and Roses 18 & rdquo ; at the Bread and Roses Gallery in Tel Aviv . inspiration : my artistic journey be fuel by the intricate dance of relationship & ndash ; those between my inner self , my corporeal form , and the world around I . the allure lie in explore the ever - shift nuance of the feminine physique , its narrative etch by life & rsquo ; s twist and turn , and its resonance across diverse cultural landscape . moreover , personal narrative , like the potent symbolism of freedom evoke by chain in select piece , serve as potent wellspring of inspiration . my art serve as a mirror reflect the interplay of inner dialogue , societal construct , and the relentless quest for liberation . meaning of art : art , to I , be a boundless realm where creativity intertwine with introspection . it manifest in myriad form . art be not merely about aesthetic ; it & rsquo ; s a profound exploration of complex theme , a challenge to establish norm , and a conduit for stir the soul . it & rsquo ; s a process that transcend boundary , beckon viewer into a realm of dialogue , reflection , and interpretation . TAUB & rsquo ; S ARTWORK : my artistic voice resonate distinctly through its intimate exploration of the feminine form and its intricate relationship with the self - image perception and body expression society . through solitary figure and intricate symbolism , I aim to evoke theme of independence , resilience , and the societal gaze upon woman & ndash ; and question historical patriarchal myth by infusion of personal narrative , and material , that be collect with a connection to the space and time . ultimately , my art distinguish itself through its poignant exploration of the human experience , beckon viewer into a silent dialogue . ellataub . com / ","three women artists, three questions"

"September 17 , 2021 mark 43 year since the signing of the Camp David Accords between former israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and former egyptian president Anwar Sadat , under the auspex of then US president Jimmy Carter . it pave the way for the 1979 israeli - egyptian peace deal , the first such treaty between Israel and one of its arab neighbor . the Camp David Accords be the culmination of considerable political machination and come just year after the conclusion of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 , widely regard as Israel 's darkest hour and where Egypt play a major role as the aggressor . the war be devastating , with the jewish state flank in a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria . though Israel achieve a military victory over its adversary and come within shell range of Damascus , the war shock the jewish state out of complacency , prompt the resignation of Israel 's prime minister Golda Meir . after the war Israelis view the egyptian military in a new , more dangerous light . however , Egypt have see the conflict differently . despite egyptian military success in the conflict , some in Cairo be convince that Israel simply could not be beat on the battlefield . as such , it seem doubtful they could use force of arm to destroy the jewish state . but one thing it undoubtedly achieve be to shift the region 's status quo . & nbsp ; two event then far change everything and set the scene for the eventual peace talk . the first event be on May 17 , 1977 . this be Israel 's general election and see the right - wing Likud Party , lead by Begin , achieve a historic upset with a landslide victory , give Israel a right - wing government for the first time ever . the second event be Sadat 's historic interview on CBS News with Walter Cronkite on November 14 of the same year . during this interview , Sadat shock the world by say that he be more than willing to actually visit Jerusalem for peace negotiation . & nbsp ; "" I want to discuss the whole situation with the 120 member of the Knesset and put the full picture and detail of the situation from our point of view , "" he say at the time . & nbsp ; this be not the first time Sadat express willingness to go to Israel , and he have say as much in a speech before the People 's Assembly just five day early . however , now his intention be make public to the world . that same day , Cronkite interview Begin and ask for his response . & ldquo ; I can assure you , Mr . Cronkite , as we really want the visit of president Sadat , we really want to negotiate the peace , to establish permanent peace in the Middle East , & rdquo ; Begin say . & ldquo ; any time , any day he be prepared to come , I will receive he cordially at the airport , and go together with he to Jerusalem , also present he to the Knesset and let he make his speech to our parliament . I will follow he onto the platform and greet he , receive he . & rdquo ; shortly after , this exact situation happen . Sadat , in an unprecedented and historic moment , arrive at Lod Airport ( know today as Ben - Gurion Airport ) . on November 20 , Sadat then make history by address the Knesset . & nbsp ; Sadat 's move throw out the rulebook , take Washington by surprise . it lead to negotiation that culminate in the Camp David Accords , which be sign at the White House by Sadat and begin in 1978 after 12 day of secret talk at Camp David . there be two framework in the accord . the first deal with the Palestinians and face condemnation for a lack of participation from the Palestinians themselves . however , the second framework be between Egypt and Israel , win both Begin and Sadat the Nobel Peace Prize and directly lead to the treaty be sign a year later . notably , as part of the accord , Israel pledge to fully withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula in its entirety .

Uri Gordin . accord to Matthew Levitt , director of the Jeanette and Eli Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Hezbollah want to & ldquo ; scratch their resistance itch . & rdquo ; while Hezbollah can attempt to do something , it do not want to drag the region into a full - blow war . Lebanon be in such a disastrous state that it understand the need for a maritime border deal , say Levitt , a former counter - terrorism official . but , he add , the group be also willing to put lebanese citizen at risk and drag Israel into a war just to use it as a scapegoat . Hezbollah , Lebanon 's massive terrorist armyunder Nasrallah , Hezbollah have grow into what the IDF describe as a & ldquo ; terror army & rdquo ; with an estimate 150 , 000 rocket and munition that can hit anywhere in the country . it be believe that in the next war , Hezbollah will try to fire close to 4 , 000 rocket per day to start , follow by some 2 , 000 per day until the last day of the conflict . in comparison , during Operation Breaking Dawn in August , Islamic Jihad fire a total of just more than 1 , 000 rocket from Gaza in three day . in a recent interview with Walla , Gordin say the IDF will prioritize the northern part of the state , since 50 % of Hezbollah & rsquo ; s arsenal be aim at city 15 km . from the border with Lebanon , include Nahariya , Acre , Safed and Kiryat Shmona . another 40 % of Hezbollah & rsquo ; s missile can reach Haifa and surround area . only 5 % can reach target far to the south . Hezbollah have not give up on work on its precision munition project . it be believe that the majority of the alleged israeli airstrike in Syria as part of its & ldquo ; war between the war & rdquo ; campaign have be target component for the project . the terrorist group also have sophisticated drone that can be use for reconnaissance mission or carry munition to attack target . though former Israel Air Force Commander Maj . - Gen ( re . ) Amikam Norkin have say the IAF lose its aerial superiority over Lebanon , Levitt argue otherwise . & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s complicate and Israel have to take more precaution , but Israel can still go where it need to , when it need to , to get what it need . & rdquo ; Matthew Levitt & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s complicate , and Israel have to take more precaution , but Israel can still go where it need to , when it need to , to get what it need , & rdquo ; he say . the group also have significant battlefield experience after their engagement on the side of Bashar Assad during the syrian civil war . Hezbollah & rsquo ; s elite Radwan force be a force to be fear and be spread across southern Lebanon wait for the order to attack Israel . & ldquo ; you have to take the Radwan force seriously , & rdquo ; say Levitt . in addition to the on - the - job training and weapon ( include American - make AR - 15s ) , the Radwan force & ldquo ; be discipline , & rdquo ; Levitt note . and while they face challenge such as the loss of senior operative , many of the Radwan troop & ldquo ; only know fight in Syria . & rdquo ; while tension have rise significantly between Israel and Hezbollah , the intelligence community do not think that Nasrallah would drag the entire region into war over the gas rig . the extraction of the gas and the potential signing of a deal between Israel and Lebanon , mediate by the United States , also come as the West believe there will not be a nuclear deal sign with Iran . Iran already send $ 800 million annually to Hezbollah , and the lack of a deal would not stop the Islamic Republic from continue to fund they . & ldquo ; Iran prioritize they , and withdraw from the JCPOA do nothing . they can afford it , & rdquo ; say Levitt .

"Interior Minister Moshe Arbel of Shas be unlike many other israeli politician . for one thing , he doesn & rsquo ; t particularly want to be a politician , and doesn & rsquo ; t have high political aspiration . if it be up to he , he would be far from the public eye , work on his doctorate in law or spend time with his family . for another , at the outbreak of the Israel - Hamas war on October 7 , Arbel request of party leader MK Arye Deri to relieve he of the dual duty of interior minister and health minister and leave he just with the former , due to the immense workload of run these two major ministry during wartime . power and influence be currency for politician , and who else in Israel & rsquo ; s political scene today volunteer to give up a major ministry ? & ldquo ; I see myself in the political arena as a reservist and not a career officer , & rdquo ; Arbel say . his use of military jargon be also rare for a haredi politician & ndash ; indeed , Arbel serve in the IDF and in the reserve for year until he become a member of Knesset . he say he be & ldquo ; not motivate by survivability , & rdquo ; and that it do not matter to he whether he serve another term in politic or not . as a result , he be focus not on reap short - term achievement but & ldquo ; prepare the ministry & rsquo ; s foundation & rdquo ; so that , when he & ldquo ; hand the key over & rdquo ; to his successor , the ministry will be well than it be now . & ldquo ; the State of Israel need people who enter public role with modesty and with the understanding that they have not conquer territory but be there to serve the public , & rdquo ; he say . Moshe Arbel 's political , rabbinic , and IDF careerARBEL , 40 , be a father of four and life in Petah Tikva . public service run in the family , as his father serve on the Petah Tikva Religious Council and be a Shas activist . but Arbel himself be a full - time Torah student until his mid - twenty , and be ordain as a rabbi . he then join the IDF Home Front Command in a unit responsible for identify corpse ; earn bachelor & rsquo ; s and master & rsquo ; s degree in law from the Ono Academic College ; serve in the IDF reserve as a military prosecutor ; earn a business administration certificate from Harvard University ; and begin a doctorate in law at Reichman University . follow the 2013 national election , Arbel serve as a legal adviser for Shas , as a legislation adviser to then Knesset member and current Labor Minister Yoav Ben - Tzur , and as a chief of staff for Deri . in April 2023 he be appoint as both health minister and interior minister , after Deri be block from the position due to previous criminal conviction . the Jerusalem Post interview Arbel in his Knesset office on April 8 , and the first issue to be discuss be the ongoing crisis over the haredi exemption from IDF service . as both a longtime haredi yeshiva student and a long - serve IDF reservist , Arbel & rsquo ; s perspective be important . his approach can be summarize as follow : the IDF have a real need for soldier , and haredi man who do not study Torah full - time should commit to IDF or other national service . at the same time , Torah study isn & rsquo ; t just a spiritual vocation but an enterprise of national importance . Arbel call this & ldquo ; the national story of a group of Torah student . . . who labor day and night over the Torah , & rdquo ; out of which will grow & ldquo ; great Torah [ scholar ] with broad shoulder . & rdquo ; accord to Arbel , these & ldquo ; broad - shoulder & rdquo ; talent be necessary in order to uphold the tradition of & ldquo ; the power of leniency , & rdquo ; a lead policy in the halachic ruling of former Sephardi chief rabbi and sha spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef . & ldquo ; the day where we enter the debate with the deep understanding that there be a national , ethical duty to maintain these Torah student , along with the duty to maintain an economic , military , and socially prosperous state , we can create an ecosystem of understanding that do not wish to erase the identity of the other side , & rdquo ; Arbel say . this fundamental premise be more important than the detail of a specific haredi conscription plan , he add . furthermore , Arbel argue that enable haredi man to serve in the IDF while maintain their lifestyle be a liberal value as well & ndash ; IDF service isn & rsquo ; t just a duty , it be also a right . the IDF currently do this & ldquo ; sufficiently & rdquo ; and should continue do so , he say . he stress that yeshiva student who be not actually study and who be & ldquo ; catch a ride & rdquo ; on the blanket exemption should serve in the idf like all other citizen . Arbel & rsquo ; s approach regard Torah study and IDF service reflect a broad view on haredi education in general . he explain that the major haredi school system teach a core secular curriculum of some form , but that this need to be expand and improve . his son , for example , study at a haredi high school yeshiva , which combine long hour of Torah study with full matriculation exam . there be many such initiative sprout up , and & ldquo ; good thing be happen & rdquo ; & ndash ; but the state need to facilitate this & ndash ; for example , by lower the high cost of the institution that offer these sort of combination . Arbel didn & rsquo ; t rule out give haredi teen the option of study Torah full - time . he himself study only Torah in his teen and complete matriculation requirement later on , and the year of Torah study grant he a work ethic and analytic skill that serve he later on in life . but such a system be not appropriate for everyone and should not be force on haredi teen who aren & rsquo ; t equip for it , he argue . ARBEL & rsquo ; S work in the Interior Ministry have garner praise from both side of the political divide , and the ministry be favorably mention for its work follow the October 7 Hamas massacre . ask about this , Arbel be quick to give credit to the ministry worker . he explain that the ministry include three branch and describe its adaptation post - October 7 in each branch . these change lead to a learning process that lead to broad initiative not just relate to war . the three branch be the local authority ; immigration and citizenship ; and urban planning and development . follow October 7 , the local authority require receive special power and funding , especially those whose resident be attack and / or evacuate . on the issue of immigration and citizenship , many of these evacuee leave their home without their passport or other identification paper , and the ministry create roam emergency office that go to hotel in order to provide service for the evacuee . finally , on the issue of urban planning and development , Arbel have the ministry pass temporary executive order to cut bureaucracy in order to speedily construct new school and medical center for the evacuee . in the day and week after the massacre , some of the survivor be traumatize to the extent that they be not willing to leave their hotel room in order to meet with the roam immigration office . this lead Arbel to wonder why they could not order new document online , and he work with the defense and other authority to begin provide this service , whose pilot be set to begin at the end of April . wait time in Israel for immigration service such as renew a passport be notoriously long , and the ability to order a new passport online could drastically improve this . the idea to enable online documentation order be an example of how the ministry & rsquo ; s ad hoc adaptation to war need lead to broad initiative , Arbel explain . he say he also put a specific emphasis on service to arab municipality . & ldquo ; on the day I enter office I say that we must understand that we be public servant of all of the citizen of Israel & ndash ; those who vote for we and those who didn & rsquo ; t , even those who be act against we , & rdquo ; Arbel say . he add that at a certain point when there be protester outside of his home , he say to his child that he be happy to live in a country in which people can protest outside the home of elect official , which be not to be take for grant . deal with arab municipality include unique challenge & ndash ; a major one , for example , be Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich refuse in 2023 to channel NIS 200 million of funding due to the concern that it could end up in the hand of criminal organization . Arbel confront Smotrich and succeed in get the fund through . in some rare case , there be also management problem , such as certain family who win the municipal election refuse to provide service to other family . Arbel add that & ldquo ; good thing & rdquo ; be happen in arab local authority , cite as an example the town Jatt near Haifa , which elect in the recent municipal election a young engineer who be unaffiliated with large family . this show that resident understand the importance of proper governance aim first and foremost at improve their daily life . Arbel view local authority as key factor in bridge social gap . & ldquo ; the goal of local authority be to break through cement ceiling , & rdquo ; he say . socioeconomic gap in Israel be unacceptably high for a country the size of a district in California , and correct investment by municipality , such as in fundamental aspect of formal and informal education & ndash ; schoolroom , teacher , hot meal , etc . & ndash ; could serve as the basis for real social mobility , which Arbel say be & ldquo ; one of the most significant tool in our national resilience . & rdquo ; the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in antisemitism worldwide since October 7 have lead to increase interest by Diaspora Jews in move to Israel . another notable initiative that Arbel mention be create an & ldquo ; aliyah eligibility document . & rdquo ; what happen , Arbel explain , be that potential olim sometimes express interest in move to Israel but do not follow through with the process , such that if they want to renew it later on they will have to start afresh . instead , Arbel propose enable these family to complete all of the necessary paperwork without actually make the move & ndash ; and thus enable they to make aliyah immediately in the future if they wish . Arbel prefer not to express his view on the situation in Gaza and the public debate about how much Israel should concede in a hostage deal . but perhaps more important than his work in the Interior Ministry and his support of haredi enlistment be his sympathy for the family of the hostage . he say he be concern by criticism that minister have not meet enough with the family of hostage since the war break out , and say that he meet at least once a week with a family . the meeting be difficult , and the family be experience immense pain and anger , but as a government minister Arbel say he do not have the right to avoid the family . he add that he & ldquo ; allow himself to cry with the family , & rdquo ; and that his moral duty be & ldquo ; first and foremost to see their pain . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;","haredi, harvard, home front command: the enigma of moshe arbel"

"& nbsp ; on Wednesday , the US - Israel relationship seem , well , normal . the US be support Israel in the way it always have in the repeat confrontation with Hamas since Israel withdraw from Gaza in 2005 . & nbsp ; the US block the United Nations Security Council from make a statement that be critical of Israel . & nbsp ; US President Joe Biden call Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , & ldquo ; condemn the rocket attack by Hamas . . . [ and ] convey his unwavering support for Israel & rsquo ; s security and for Israel & rsquo ; s legitimate right to defend itself , while protect civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasize that & ldquo ; there be a very clear and absolute distinction between the terrorist organization Hamas that be indiscriminately rain down rocket target civilian , and Israel & rsquo ; s response defend itself , target the terrorist rain down rocket on Israel . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Blinken dispatch Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr to Israel to help in the de - escalation effort . & nbsp ; but all that happen on Wednesday , three day after Hamas shoot rocket into Jerusalem and five day after a serious uptick in violence in Jerusalem . these be short amount of time in the grand scheme of thing , but a long time in term of an escalation . & nbsp ; the night before that , at the very same time that Hamas shoot 150 rocket into Tel Aviv and central Israel , send million of Israelis into bomb shelter , the Biden administration & rsquo ; s spokespeople sync up on a & ldquo ; both side & rdquo ; message , despite one side be Israel , a US ally and a democracy , and the other be Hamas , designate by the US as a terrorist organization . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we condemn ongoing rocket attack by Hamas and other terrorist group , include against Jerusalem . we also stand against extremism that have inflict violence on both community , & rdquo ; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki say . & nbsp ; Psaki soon move on to adopt the Palestinians & rsquo ; narrative that this be about the Sheikh Jarrah / Shimon Hatzadik land dispute & ndash ; the ruling on which have yet to be make , and whose resident have not actually be evict & ndash ; rather than take in the context of rise palestinian and arab violence for the past month . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we believe Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal measure of freedom , security , dignity , and prosperity , & rdquo ; Psaki say . & ldquo ; and US official , in recent week , have speak candidly with israeli official about how eviction of palestinian family who have live for year , sometimes decade , in their home and of demolition of these home work against our common interest in achieve a solution to the conflict . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; similarly , State Department spokesman Ned Price say minute early that & ldquo ; Israel have the right to defend itself and to respond to rocket attack . the palestinian people also have the right to safety and security , just as Israelis do . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we be also deeply concerned about the report loss of life in Gaza and Israel , include the death of child as well as many innocent civilian injure . similarly , in Jerusalem , where there reportedly have be hundred of Palestinians injure , as well as israeli police , we call on all side to exercise restraint and to exercise calm . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; emerge from bomb shelter soon after those statement be make , the Israelis pay attention to Psaki and Price may have scratch their head as to why Israel & rsquo ; s great ally be lecture they while they be rush their family to safety from rocket launch indiscriminately at civilian by a terrorist organization . & nbsp ; over the past week , the Biden administration & rsquo ; s message also focus on & ldquo ; de - escalation . & rdquo ; they & rsquo ; re engage at all level , official and spokespeople say , to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to de - escalate . push by journalist in numerous press briefing to explain what that mean , what they & rsquo ; re actually do to bring the side away from the brink of war , the member and representative of the administration didn & rsquo ; t have much to say . & nbsp ; MORE than one senior israeli official say they & rsquo ; re satisfied with the US position , point to statement by Biden and Blinken , as well as another by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan , as & ldquo ; very supportive , & rdquo ; as well as to american effort in the UN to block the statement against Israel . & nbsp ; in other word , the thing that they be do , on a practical level , be supportive of Israel , and they be keep Israel in the loop , as an ally would be expect to do . & nbsp ; israeli official also say they don & rsquo ; t feel that the US be pressure they to stop the operation in Gaza , another clear sign of support . & nbsp ; but one of those israeli official also say that they & ldquo ; don & rsquo ; t have a clue . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; for four month , the Biden administration make Israel and the Palestinians a low priority . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; they didn & rsquo ; t even think about Gaza and Hamas , & rdquo ; the official say . & ldquo ; when the palestinian election come up , they didn & rsquo ; t know how to handle it . election be a democratic value , but Hamas could be elect , so they play the same game Israel do . they didn & rsquo ; t oppose it publicly , but they send message they win & rsquo ; t be mad if it & rsquo ; s postpone . . . . and now Hamas be frustrate . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; on the one hand , the Biden administration & ndash ; from Blinken and Sullivan to Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas - Greenfield to State Department official & ndash ; really be constantly in contact with Israelis , as its member have be say in their statement and briefing . & nbsp ; on the other , the administration have be fixate on Jerusalem , the Temple Mount and Sheikh Jarrah in private conversation , accept the palestinian narrative on the event . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; nothing change on the Temple Mount , except that Hamas be try to present itself as defend the holy place , like Arafat do in 2000 . . . . Hamas be frustrate that the Palestinian Authority postpone the election , think it would strengthen they , and now they & rsquo ; re try to build themselves up . the narrative that Jerusalem be the real problem be that of our opponent , & rdquo ; the israeli official say . & nbsp ; israeli official have find themselves be ask by member of the Biden administration to stop a possible Supreme Court ruling to evict four palestinian family from Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t even understand the argument , & rdquo ; the official say . & ldquo ; we & rsquo ; re a democracy . we do the maximum to postpone the ruling , but we don & rsquo ; t control the court . it & rsquo ; s the same court that evict settler . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; as for complaint about Israel use stun grenade in the al - Aksa Mosque , the official point out that israeli police do not use gun at the holy site , but that people throw boulder at worshiper at the Western Wall and Molotov cocktail at police can not be give immunity just because they use a mosque as a launch pad . & nbsp ; an israeli official also express concern that the Biden administration be more supportive in private conversation than in public statement . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; they use to say that Israel doesn & rsquo ; t have foreign policy , only domestic politic . our feeling be they & rsquo ; re constantly look at the left - wing extreme [ of the Democratic Party ] that be against we and their pressure on they , & rdquo ; the official say . & ldquo ; they & rsquo ; re put Jerusalem in all their message , even though it & rsquo ; s not really connect , and then they talk about the need for restraint on both side . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; in a way , it seem like the administration be catch off guard when the violence spiral . & nbsp ; some have argue that the government in Jerusalem do not take the potential for a conflagration seriously enough , and Israel will have to reckon with how its leadership vacuum leave it unprepared . that may have color Washington & rsquo ; s initial reaction . & nbsp ; but it didn & rsquo ; t have to be that way . UAE - base news site the National say that & ldquo ; Washington begin to pay attention to message from arab government only last week , & rdquo ; after week of warning that a crisis be brew in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Shira Efron , a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies , also note the & ldquo ; bifurcate message & rdquo ; come from the Biden administration , with message that create an equivalence between Israel and its enemy , while also say & ldquo ; this be a just fight , Hamas be a cruel terrorist organization and Israel should fight back . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; read between the line , Efron say she think the Biden administration be & ldquo ; say Israel have get it ; they can handle it . I don & rsquo ; t see they actively work to de - escalate . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; even Amr & rsquo ; s visit may be largely symbolic , because , as Efron point out , the US doesn & rsquo ; t speak with Hamas . at most , Amr can work with other mediator that do speak with Hamas , like Turkey , Qatar or Egypt , and then relay message to Israel . & nbsp ; Efron question whether the Biden administration have & ldquo ; a road map for de - escalation . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; she note the Biden administration have de - emphasize the israeli - palestinian conflict : & ldquo ; they have big fish to fry , like China or climate change , but the fact be that there be no assistant secretary for Near East affair , and there be no ambassador here . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; even the most competent and well - mean person & ndash ; and I think [ Amr ] do mean well & ndash ; can not do this on his own , & rdquo ; Efron say . & ldquo ; he have no staff , and I don & rsquo ; t think this be a priority issue & rdquo ; for the Biden administration . & nbsp ; if the late event be a wake - up call for the administration , it still can not immediately solve its lack of preparation for a crisis in the region , Efron say . it will take time for Congress to confirm presidential appointment . & nbsp ; the tone from Washington would have be drastically different if former president Donald Trump be still in office , but Efron push back against the argument that there would be significant change on the ground . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think this have much to do with the US approach . Biden say they & rsquo ; re go to go back to a more traditional approach , but the fact be that not much have change . it hasn & rsquo ; t be transformational ; it & rsquo ; s not like the Palestinians be now welcome in Washington with a PLO mission , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; rather , Efron argue , between Ramadan , COVID - 19 frustration and the cancellation of the palestinian election , violence against Israel be a & ldquo ; win - win & rdquo ; for Hamas , and the US reaction be unlikely to be a primary or even secondary consideration . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; in 2009 , 2012 and 2014 , there be lengthy IDF operation where we have a US that be more active in favor of the Palestinians , and that didn & rsquo ; t help either , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; Prof . Eytan Gilboa of Bar - Ilan University , however , argue that Trump would have more full - throatedly condemn Hamas and Islamic Jihad , and that would have have a palpable impact . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Trump punish the Palestinians . Biden be try to appease they . so I think there would have be a different story if Trump have be in the White House , in term of oppose and condemn Islamic Jihad and Hamas and support Israel more , & rdquo ; he say . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s strategy , Gilboa explain , be to punish Hamas and Islamic Jihad severely , which will take time . US statement call to stop hostility weaken Israel in pursuit of that strategy . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the american response overall have be timid , disappointing and irrelevant . . . say Palestinians in Gaza have the right for safety and security just as Israelis do . . . as if this be a confrontation between equal , & rdquo ; Gilboa say . & ldquo ; both side be call on to reduce hostility & ndash ; Israel and a terrorist organization designate by the US . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s not evenhandedness . it & rsquo ; s stupidity . this inadvertently encourage Hamas and Islamic Jihad to continue , & rdquo ; he add . & nbsp ; similar to the israeli official , Gilboa think the Biden administration have read the situation wrong by focus on Sheikh Jarrah , which he call & ldquo ; irrelevant . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the main point be Hamas and Islamic Jihad & rsquo ; s goal of turn the West Bank into Gaza , of take it over . . . . if you don & rsquo ; t understand that , then your policy will miss the point , & rdquo ; he state . & ldquo ; the alumnus of the Obama administration seem to have learn nothing . they & rsquo ; re present as very experienced in foreign policy and national security ; that have yet to be prove . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; by make the Middle East a low priority , Biden will now learn that & ldquo ; if you run away from the Middle East , the Middle East run after you , & rdquo ; Gilboa warn . & ldquo ; the US have to take a position . . . . it require fresh thinking , but what I see be old habit . & rdquo ;","as israel-palestinian conflict rages, biden struggles to catch up"

"north of the Gaza Strip , the surf be pound the beach south of Ashkelon . one of these beach be know as Zikim , and it share a name with a kibbutz on a hill above it . this be a beautiful area . there be a small pond and stream near the beach , and dune with small stout layer of brush stretch up from the waterfront toward the east . the dune form a kind of frame to the area , set off the kibbutz and a road that run down to the sea from an industrial area of Ashkelon . today , this area be desert . the beach , which once host the toned body of young man and woman from the area who come to enjoy the spot , and the fisherman who would come on weekend to try their hand at a catch , be go . it be all go because Hamas attack this beach on October 7 , when it invade two dozen point along the border with Israel and carry out its massacre . I come to this area on October 8 , try to reach the coastal area because there be several IDF post here . I think that with the war unfolding , it might be a good place to find a story . at the time , I didn & rsquo ; t know there be still fight go on in this area , and terrorist be lurk in the bush and dune . I learn the area be an active combat zone when I come upon the body of two terrorist , and a still - run Savannah van park next to they , on October 8 near the fence that run around Kibbutz Zikim . the fighting here continue for day . on October 11 , several soldier from the Maglan special unit be kill in this area . flag with their name be now drape on a concrete shelter along the road . inside , their comrade have write their name and leave candle and a kippah in their memory . six month laterIT have be six month since that day . October 8 be the second day of the war . six month later , I be in Kibbutz Zikim , look out onto the road where I have encounter the dead terrorist and the van . a member of the community recall the same scene unfold on October 7 from inside Zikim . although terrorist be able to attack and infiltrate the IDF post near the border , kill soldier and massacre civilian on Zikim Beach , the kibbutz itself be save by the quick response of its emergency response team and soldier . today , the kibbutz seem like it be slowly return to life , and some of the resident have return . the community be lay out in a large circle , with house face the perimeter fence , look toward the sea . it & rsquo ; s bucolic and beautiful . it be also fill with peacock for some reason . the bird apparently escape from a local small zoo and have infest the community for year . because there be so few human resident , the animal seem to have the run of the place . I spend October 7 and 8 travel along the border with Gaza , see community that face the brunt of the attack on October 7 and also see those that be save from the massacre . each community have a story & ndash ; story of tragedy , bravery , and sometimes good luck that keep people safe . six month after the war begin , it & rsquo ; s important to recall that these community be still evacuate , their resident scatter around Israel . in many case , the community try to stick together , but they face an uncertain future . on the afternoon of October 8 , the IDF say it have evacuate Be & rsquo ; eri , Nahal Oz , Netiv Ha & rsquo ; asara , and Zikim . while Zikim have be save from the massacre , nearby Netiv Ha & rsquo ; asara , which be directly on the border with Gaza , be breach , and the terrorist murder numerous member of the community . the terrorist also carry out massacre at Be & rsquo ; eri and Nahal Oz . Nahal Oz be one of the hard community & rsquo ; s to reach today because it be close to the border , and there be an IDF checkpoint on the road lead to it . all of these community now have soldier at their front gate , and permission be require to enter . Nahal Oz be a unique case . to get to it , the road snake down by the border . several year ago , a large concrete wall be erect to shield the road from Gaza , and the wall be then paint with pastoral scene and a giant mural indicate that the community be celebrate 70 year since its founding . unlike Zikim , there be a sense it will take time before anyone can return to this area . on October 8 , the IDF also evacuate Nir Am , Mefalsim , Kfar Aza , Gevim , or Haner , Ivim , Yad Mordechai , Karmiya , Kerem Shalom , Kissufim , Holit , Sufa , Nirim , Nir Oz , Ein Hashlosha , Nir Yitzhak , Magen , re & rsquo ; I m , Sa & rsquo ; ad , and Alumim . today , these community have the same struggle that Zikim and Nahal Oz face . their resident be live in different part of Israel , and it be not clear when service will be available for people to return to or if people will feel secure enough to return . in some community , people return only for a few hour a day or several day a week . they might have job nearby , or they come to tend a garden or to do some kind of other work for the community . in the community dining hall , where there once would have be crowd or laughter , or plan for community event , there be often silence or only a few people huddle to eat . IT & rsquo ; s HARD to make sense of this . on the one hand , the war in Gaza feel like it be wind down . at the high point in Zikim , for instance , there be an old home build in 1920 by an Arab notable who have a citrus grove near here . from the roof of the old stately home , where sandbag be pile , probably from the early day of the war , one can see into Gaza . smoke rise , and there be a rat - tat of machine - gun fire . but the sound of artillery and explosion be no long common . far down the border , this be not always the case . near the site of the Supernova music festival massacre , the sound of artillery be present . everywhere along the border , the buzzing of drone be clear . but the heavy military presence of the first month of the war be go . it & rsquo ; s not normal , because normal would mean the civilian resident have return . it & rsquo ; s abnormal . but it & rsquo ; s also not war , because much of the war seem to have pause , like a country take a deep breath and then wonder what to do next . what come next at Kibbutz Sufa , for instance ? it sit near the border and feel forlorn . at nearby Nir Yitzhak , there be square hay bale stack in small mountain in warehouse . clearly , the agricultural work have go on at a fever pitch . in fact , that & rsquo ; s another contrast on the border . work go on everywhere in the field . in some case , it be do by foreign worker , who can be see ride motorize bike to their work . small Thailand flag flutter from the bike . in one field , a giant machine with long metal arm , like a massive mechanical bug in some kind of future apocalyptic movie , amble along water the field . it wasn & rsquo ; t even clear if there be a person on the machine , bring a sense that the future here hang in the balance between civilian return and machine take over . this be not what the kibbutz pioneer of the late 1940 and 1950 have in mind when these community be found . they live in tent and farm . they take their bolt - action rifle , and later automatic , to the field with they . they dance , and sing , and play sport . they serve in elite unit . they grow old . their descendant want to return , but so far , it be mostly the old people who express steadfastness and confidence . those with child who be abandon for many hour on October 7 , and have to leave on October 8 , face an uncertain future . how can they return and trust the state again to protect they ? the state hasn & rsquo ; t return the hostage hold in Gaza . there & rsquo ; s also a sense the government have abandon these community , that there be lack of care for they , and that there be no government here . they be fend for themselves , like in the era of the British Mandate . these community be once the heart of the state & rsquo ; s endeavor to carve out the border of Israel . but now they feel like they have become the ultimate periphery . & nbsp ;",gaza border communities struggling to recover six months after evacuation

"a bulgarian prosecutor provide detailed evidence to the bulgarian court handle Hezbollah & rsquo ; s involvement in the 2012 Burgas bus bombing which kill five Israelis and their bulgarian - muslim bus driver , but the court refuse to accept it , the Jerusalem Post have learn . & nbsp ; despite an official court transcript of these detail and an appeal by the israeli victim & rsquo ; lawyer Yaki Rand to convince the bulgarian appeal court to issue conviction , include terrorism charge against Hezbollah , the Post also understand there be a high chance that Bulgaria & rsquo ; s judiciary be look to put the case to bed . & nbsp ; throughout the trial there be a dispute about bulgarian official allegedly try to charge only the individual , while seek to avoid anger Hezbollah by name it in the case . & nbsp ; for year , bulgarian prosecutor claim that they have no evidence with which to tie the two defendant , who be eventually give life sentence in absentia , directly to Hezbollah and terrorism . & nbsp ; yet , on September 17 , 2020 , after the full trial and conviction and only four day before the sentencing hearing , the prosecutor finally admit on the record that there be significant evidence on the issue . & nbsp ; the prosecutor proceed to detail the evidence into the court record , but since the conviction have already be set , the bulgarian trial court say its hand be tie and that it could not reopen the case to charge Hezbollah and add terrorism charge . & nbsp ; Rand have ask the bulgarian appeal court to order the case reopen in order to add the new charge raise by the prosecutor & rsquo ; late additional comment , but there be indication that the judiciary want to be do with the case . & nbsp ; it be highly unusual for prosecutor to raise new fact and charge post - conviction , and it be still unclear why the prosecutor do not raise the evidence during the trial itself . & nbsp ; the case shake Europe to its foundation for its audacity , but leave the family of the victim and Israel partially unsatisfie because Hezbollah itself be not formally indict or convict . & nbsp ; at a July 2019 anniversary ceremony for the victim , their family have demand that Hezbollah itself be charge in the bulgarian trial for commit an act of terrorism . & nbsp ; in his speech , Kobi Price , one of the family member , note that , & ldquo ;

& nbsp ; he reiterate to the Post on Monday that it be unclear how much deterrence or justice could be achieve against the attacker if Hezbollah as an organization be leave untouched . & nbsp ; in January 2018 , the Post exclusively disclose that the bulgarian state prosecution have decide not to charge Hezbollah as an organization with involvement in the 2012 bomb attack at the Burgas airport . & nbsp ; instead , the prosecutor indict the two man allegedly involve in the attack as if they be terrorist or even regular criminal who act without connection to an organization . the word & ldquo ; Hezbollah & rdquo ; do not appear in the indictment . & nbsp ; in addition , the indictment do not mention standard terrorism offense such as & ldquo ; act as part of a terrorist organization & rdquo ; or connect the murder offense to terrorism , refer instead merely to disturb public order . & nbsp ; source close to the case tell the Post at the time that when the bulgarian prosecutor be confront with these anomaly , he claim that no one provide he with evidence demonstrate Hezbollah & rsquo ; s involvement . & nbsp ; this directly contradict evidence that come to light immediately after the attack from bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov name Hezbollah as the culprit . & nbsp ; in 2013 , Tsvetanov & rsquo ; s successor , Tsvetlin Yovchev , tell reporter before a commemoration ceremony , & ldquo ; there be clear sign that say Hezbollah be behind the Burgas bombing . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; also in 2013 , then - bulgarian foreign minister Nikolay Mladenov and israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both confirm the solid evidence link Hezbollah to the Burgas attack . & nbsp ;

Toby Dershowitz , senior vice president for government relation and Strategy at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a nonpartisan think tank focus on national security , tell the Post at the time of sentencing that & ldquo ; Bulgaria have long know that Hezbollah be behind this horrific attack and have be clear about it . the fact that Bulgaria say it only have a mechanism to prosecute individual , and not organization , should not permit Hezbollah to yet again murder with impunity . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; the Post previously report that Bulgaria send extradition order to Lebanon & rsquo ; s government regard the two Hezbollah operative who be then charge with the act of terrorism . & nbsp ; the lebanese - australian Meliad Farah and lebanese - canadian Hassan El Hajj Hassan , who have be convict of blow up the tour bus in Burgas , Bulgaria , be believe to be in Lebanon . & nbsp ;

"as a global innovation powerhouse , Israel be actively integrate cut - edge artificial intelligence ( AI ) technology across all facet of society , recognize the vital importance of these advancement . & ldquo ; AI will lead to unimaginable transformation at all level and impact every aspect of our life and the life of future generation . this be the next industrial revolution , & rdquo ; state President Isaac Herzog . but do this avant - garde spirit extend to the creative realm , where generative art offer a captivate glimpse into the fusion of human ingenuity and machine intelligence ? on the screen , digital dream come alive with lush vegetation , ephemeral flower , and flow water . this be the AI - create world of & ldquo ; Botanic Reverie & rdquo ; by Ronen Tanchum , an israeli artist work at the forefront of technology . & ldquo ; my aim be for audience to feel my artwork and engage with it on a deep emotional level , & rdquo ; say Ronen . inspire by nature , he use generative algorithm to explore new aesthetic territory that exist on the boundary between the natural and the imagine . AI allow we to take a fresh look at familiar image , reveal unexpected facet of beauty . & ldquo ; my work pulsate with theme of synthetic nature , bloom phenomenon , and digital - human synchrony , explore the human - machine - environment relationship , & rdquo ; Tanchum say . contemporary artist be increasingly experiment with generative technique , bring their bold creative idea to life . but how do this art of the future work ? algorithm train on vast dataset can create image , video , and even music in response to textual prompt or visual example . utilize complex mathematical model , neural network identify pattern and generate content that align with user - define parameter . then , with additional command , human edit the generate image until the desire result be achieve . in this process , the artist become a kind of conductor , guide the machine & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; creative & rdquo ; effort . London - base israeli photographer Ori Gersht demonstrate how AI can expand the expressive possibility of traditional medium in his project & ldquo ; Fields & amp ; Visions & amp ; ( another World ) . & rdquo ; when process his own photograph , the artist invite the neural network to reinterpret and literally & ldquo ; build upon & rdquo ; the original image & ndash ; now , they balance on the edge of photography and digital painting . & ldquo ; the combination of the precise trace of the optical lens in harmony with the computerized interpretation of artificial intelligence capture a shift in our concept of reality , as these photograph be no long a faithful depiction of the physical subject matter , & rdquo ; comment Gersht . with this experiment , the artist transform the very nature of photography , lead the viewer into a space of imagination . the ethical ramification of AI artof course , it & rsquo ; s not so straightforward . in Israel , as around the world , there be an extensive public discussion surround generative art . it & rsquo ; s questionable whether it can be consider genuine art if a substantial portion of the work be do by a machine rather than a human . while diversity of approach and freedom of expression be hallmark of israeli art & ndash ; just as they be of its society as a whole & ndash ; a majority of israeli artist continue to work successfully with traditional fine art material . Guy Yanai , an israeli painter well - establish on the international art scene , tell the Jerusalem Post that he do not use AI tool in his art . at the same time , he note that every industrial revolution have a beneficial impact on the evolution of art , push the boundary of creative exploration and opening up new dimension of creativity . expert also point out that generative art challenge the establish understanding of the creative process and the very concept of an artwork . & ldquo ; I view generative art as a new method that may complement other contemporary as well as traditional practice , & rdquo ; Irena Gordon , chief curator of the Petah Tikva Museum say . & ldquo ; while it be exciting as a starting point , in the end it be up to the artist to use it to create good and meaningful art . & rdquo ; the integration of AI into the artistic sphere raise a number of important ethical and legal question . who be the author of a work create by an algorithm ? how do we assess the authenticity and value of such art ? particularly heat discussion revolve around copyright for generative content and privacy issue when algorithm process personal datum . Israel & rsquo ; s recently adopt & ldquo ; Responsible Innovation & rdquo ; policy for AI regulation , aim at find a balance between technological progress , ethical norm , and public interest , be intend to serve as a guide for the integration of AI , include in the creative industry . & ldquo ; the revolutionary impact of AI technology be yield constant improvement in the quality of life for Israel & rsquo ; s citizen in countless field . however , along with the numerous benefit , there be also many risk . we must ensure that the human remain at the center of AI development , & rdquo ; say Innovation , Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis . however , it would be incorrect to claim that AI have completely and suddenly take over art in Israel . rather , it have complement the extensive list of tool in the arsenal of contemporary artist . digital art in Israel encompass a wide range of technology , demonstrate the openness of local artist to innovation and experimentation , from 3d modeling , VR , and AR to generative graphic , animation , and more . these medium often intersect and overlap in the practice of artist , create complex artistic statement in the language of contemporary techno - culture . this be the language in which Ruth Patir , represent Israel at this year & rsquo ; s Venice Biennale , also express herself . her project & ldquo ; ( M ) otherland & rdquo ; masterfully combine documentary narrative with advanced computer - generate imagery ( cgi ) technology . in her work , the artist use 3d animation to convey her idea to a digital - age audience in a language most understandable to they . & ldquo ; for I , create work that expand the vocabulary of the digital asset have become something I be really eager to fight for , & rdquo ; Patir say , note , & ldquo ; my practice doesn & rsquo ; t focus on technology , it be only a facade of whatever be the contemporary moment we be live . & rdquo ; creative experiment with technology be also resonate in the local art market . gallery and collector , primarily of the young generation , be show increase interest in new medium . the first auction sale of NFT work by israeli artist take place in 2022 at Tiroche auction in Herzliya , with lot sell for record amount for this segment , reach the upper estimate . sale of digital art on the secondary market indicate the successful integration of this genre into the commercial context . lead cultural institution in Israel be gradually include generative art along with other digital art in their exhibition and educational program . however , it should be note that these be still only tentative attempt , and truly large - scale exhibition project explore the theme of AI be still ahead for Israelis . it be equally crucial to discuss the challenge . Vladimir Opredelenov , a lead expert on digitalization for creative industry , warn the Jerusalem Post about the risk of fall behind technological progress : & ldquo ; cultural institution need to change their mindset and implement innovative solution to avoid find themselves in a kind of & lsquo ; blackout . & rsquo ; if they do not become part of the global digital ecosystem , they risk lose relevance and audience in the era of intelligent machine . museum must actively study and apply AI technology in their work & ndash ; from curate and research to collection management and visitor engagement . & rdquo ; moreover , the integration of AI into artistic practice require art professional to continually improve their digital literacy and master new technological tool . to effectively leverage the capability of AI for creativity , analysis , curating , and audience engagement , employee of museum , gallery , and other cultural institution need to actively develop digital competency , and stay up - to - date with the late technology trend . AI also open up previously unseen opportunity , particularly in the realm of preserve historical memory and cultural heritage . algorithm can efficiently analyze vast amount of digitize archival datum , systematize it , extract valuable information , and even aid in reconstruct lose artifact . at Yad Vashem Museum , AI technology be use to process million of document , identify holocaust victim , and create installation that immerse visitor in the context of historical event . & ldquo ; AI be not just another technological trend , it be a fundamental shift that will affect every aspect of our life , & rdquo ; lead world expert in AI and co - founder of Navan Ilan Twig say . & ldquo ; this technology have already firmly enter our life and will only develop far . it be important for the art community to embrace these change and learn to harness the potential of AI in the most productive way . & rdquo ;",when art meets ai: israel's journey into generative art

Sam Elliott , who play the wise old cowboy in the Big Lebowski , be her love interest , and his character be similarly adrift . but the story isn & rsquo ; t all straight line and big laugh , end with a clinch . one element that set it apart be a storyline where she befriend her pool cleaner , a young man who aspire to write song and feel stick , and to whom she can open up in a way she can & rsquo ; t with her old friend . the pool cleaner be play by Martin Starr , whom you may know as Gilfoyle , the Satan - worship programmer in Silicon Valley . while I love he in that series , I actually didn & rsquo ; t recognize he here , and without his strange Gilfoyle hairstyle , he be a handsome lead man type , with an edge . & nbsp ; while I watch this movie , I start out envy the character because they be live their life in a world that be so peaceful , without war or terrorism or the thousand of other thing that make life in Israel challenge . but by the end I realize that , to quote a line from the norwegian movie 1001 Grams , & ldquo ; Life & rsquo ; s heavy burden be have nothing to carry . & rdquo ; MUCH be come up soon in May , include a number of movie and series to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day , notably the series the Tattooist of Auschwitz , which star Harvey Keitel in an adaptation of the book of the same name . there will be much more programming devote to mark this day , include documentary , series , and feature film , as well as movie devote to Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel & rsquo ; s Wars and Independence Day , which will be fill with deep sorrow this year , since the loss of October 7 and the subsequent war .","check out 'bros,' netflix's first hebrew-original series"

"Israel should not re - occupy the Gaza Strip , and should make sure Palestinians still rule the area , Commanders for Israel & rsquo ; s Security ( CIS ) and other former top defense official say in its recommendation for how Israel should handle Gaza post - topple Hamas . in contrast , several official familiar with government deliberation on the issue be far more circumspect about share their view , and about whether a serious strategy can be frame , before the outcome of the ground invasion ( which continue to be delay ) become clear . accord to the senior former security official , & ldquo ; the war must end decisively for Israel , in a manner which will restore Israel & rsquo ; s stand and enhance deterrence . towards this end , diplomatic , economic and other tool of statecraft should be pursue alongside the military campaign . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; Israel have no intention of occupy the Gaza Strip and will not reassume responsibility for it . the Gaza Strip must be rule by a palestinian government with the assistance of international entity and a direct connection to the palestinian government in the West Bank , & rdquo ; say CIS . far , CIS say , & ldquo ; Israel should relinquish control of the territory capture during the operation as quickly as possible and should not repeat the scenario of becoming mire in the lebanese quagmire . this imperative do not include territory capture for the purpose of widen the buffer zone . & rdquo ; question about this new palestinian regime in GazaCIS & rsquo ; s strategy paper be one of the most detailed to date on the issue by top official , though it still leave many open question : what form will a new palestinian regime in Gaza take ? how much will the Palestinian Authority dominate this regime versus local representative from Gaza ? give Hamas & rsquo ; s success at eliminate organize internal opposition , how will Gaza have local representative if none of the class of Hamas , ruler for the last 15 year , will be allow in the new regime ? & nbsp ; also : why will this new palestinian government , with whatever unidentified international assistance , succeed in keep Hamas down where the PA , UNFIL , and other international peacekeeping group have fail in the past to keep down determine local violent group ? finally , CIS say to avoid the israeli model of the early 1980 of interfere with who run Lebanon , but suggest an unidentified large security zone . this large security zone idea be another large piece of what keep Israel mire deep in the & ldquo ; lebanese quagmire & rdquo ; for almost another 20 year . a top former intelligence official separate from this group give a wide number of potential choice of what could happen to Gaza post Hamas . & ldquo ; we need to take apart Hamas , and any future ruler of Gaza can not bring back the military power . all of Oslo be base on the paradigm of demilitarization . we drop this requirement for Hamas . we need to hand off Gaza to Egypt , or the Palestinian Authority , Jordan , or the UAE , & rdquo ; say the former top intelligence official . however , he add , & ldquo ; maybe no one will want to take it . & rdquo ; despite this dilemma , he state , & ldquo ; that even in the bad case , it would take year for some other bad actor to achieve the militarization level of Hamas . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; Hamas have 15 year for its military buildup . and it be not just that we do not disrupt their militarization .

Ben Shabbat appear to be concern that the invasion itself continue to be delay and to look more surgical and less aggressive than Netanyahu and other official & rsquo ; public statement would suggest . regard the multiple official familiar with government debate on the issue , one note that Israel may not have a dominant role in decide who to hand Gaza to , even if it militarily defeat the Gaza group . in other word , once Israel refuse to hold on to Gaza itself , and ask for international help , Jerusalem may be stick with arrangement sponsor by the UN , the US , or some other mix of power . other imply that the invasion itself be so large , and the guerilla war afterward so unclear and vague , that it be nearly impossible to plan post - war issue until the shape of the war itself eventually become clear . & nbsp ;",gaza must be ruled by palestinians with int'l help - ex-defense chiefs

I have to do all my work and any exercise in my bedroom . & nbsp ; we have just go through a war with Gaza that have include missile fire at Jerusalem . it have throw Oren & rsquo ; s school schedule out of whack ; now it be the end of the summer and he be home for 14 indescribably long day . when his repetitive question begin to bother my mother , she would start yell at he . I could not leave they alone in the living room , even to go to the bathroom . he didn & rsquo ; t react right away but later in the day , he would have violent tantrum , usually when I tell he it be time for he to stop play on the computer . & nbsp ; but that be not the bad of itbut that wasn & rsquo ; t the bad of it . the bad of it be that I have stop sleep . & nbsp ; all right , that & rsquo ; s an exaggeration . I sleep a little , but never more than four hour a night and usually much less . I have a sleeping - pill prescription at one point , but my doctor say it be too much , I need to stop , and he wouldn & rsquo ; t renew it . & nbsp ; he didn & rsquo ; t understand , though . my father have be bipolar , and I know how it be when someone stop sleep & ndash ; the sloppiness and the craziness that come out . I could feel myself head that way . & nbsp ; the day we go to the Israel Museum back then , my mother be home watch tennis with my young son , Ben . it be okay to leave they together , and I hope my mother would never lose it with he the way she do with Oren . Ben be affect by Oren & rsquo ; s tantrum more than any of we , I feel . Oren be my son ; as his mother , I have sign on for this , for well or bad . but Ben have never ask for any of this , and as Oren & rsquo ; s outburst have get bad , Ben have get more and more withdraw and rarely come out of his room . & nbsp ; Oren and I walk through the sculpture garden that summer day and stop outside the child & rsquo ; s wing . the guard be real tough ass there , and Oren & rsquo ; s loud voice and jumping would instantly get he throw out of any other part of the museum . he climb the structure outside that kid be allow to climb , a kind of pyramid that he lower himself down into until only his long foot be visible . be upside down like that seem to calm he , and he be quiet as we walk into the child & rsquo ; s wing , where a film about city be show , call Dies Irae . the room where it be play be cool and empty , and we sit down . I have to Google die irae to find out that it mean & ldquo ; day of rage . & rdquo ; the film show rapidly shift cityscape , and Oren and I be both transfix . & nbsp ; I have bring a book with I to read during any kid & rsquo ; movie we might see there . it cheer I even now to remember that I be actually read a book then . how could I ever have find the time and energy ? & nbsp ; but it be the perfect book for I right then : the financial Lives of the Poets by Jess Walter . it be a novel about an unemployed journalist who make disastrous real estate and career decision and briefly try to deal weed to help he out of the mess he be in , while cope with a cheat wife and a live - in , senile father . a different story from mine , but we share a few thing & ndash ; include insomnia . & nbsp ; at one point in the story , the hero read an article about chronic insomnia which say that it cause & ldquo ; & lsquo ; a steep decline in neural activity which can eventually lead to severe hallucination , delirium , mania , even psychotic break & ndash ; then death & ndash ; & rsquo ; then death ? wait . just like that ? shit . . . a few day without sleep and you go from slurred speech and bad decision to . . . death ? well , that hardly seem fair . it feel like they leave out a few step . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; I have see the psychotic break of my own father and I know I be slip , slip . God , I shouldn & rsquo ; t have be drive at that time . it & rsquo ; s funny that they can test your alcohol level but not the fact that you haven & rsquo ; t have a good night & rsquo ; s sleep in month . & ldquo ; Empire State Building , & rdquo ; say Oren as an image of New York flash on the screen . he have live in New York until he be four and be still crazy about the subway and big building , which he look at on YouTube video . I have not be able to bring he back for a visit in year , his behavior be too erratic , but his love for the city be strong . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the Chrysler Building , & rdquo ; he add a moment later . & nbsp ; a few month early , when my friend & rsquo ; kid in the US be graduate from high school and my israeli friend & rsquo ; kid be join the army , Oren & rsquo ; s father and I have go to family court to become his legal guardian . that & rsquo ; s what you will eventually have to do when you have a special - need kid after he turn 18 . the school send home the initial paperwork , and a government representative come to the school to do back - to - back interview with parent and the kid & ndash ; just a formality . eventually , we have to go to the court building without Oren and do some final paperwork . a few week later , the document show we be now his guardian arrive in the mail . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the Statue of Liberty , & rdquo ; Oren say , and my mind reel with gratitude to the filmmaker and curator & ndash ; that they have come up with something that Oren find absorb . & nbsp ; the day before we visit the museum , the New York Times have run a magazine story on what they claim be the nearly 10 % of people diagnose with autism who & ldquo ; lose their diagnosis & rdquo ; and become completely mainstreamed , usually as a result of a kind of behavioral therapy that have leave Oren in bad shape than before he start it . People keep email this article to I . & nbsp ; I have forget almost everything about the Dies Irae film , but it must have be a masterpiece because it make I forget about my mother and all of my other problem & ndash ; for as long as 20 second at a time . at the end of the film , a quote from the Requiem Mass appear on screen , and I scrawl it down on the back page of the financial Lives of the poet : remember that I be the cause of your journey ; do not lose I on that day . the most relaxing place in israelwe walk out of the child & rsquo ; s wing . Oren ask to go home , but I couldn & rsquo ; t face the nightly routine yet , with all the possibility for tantrum and outburst from my mother , so I suggest walk a little more in the sculpture garden and , to my surprise , he agree . & nbsp ; it can be the most relaxing place in Israel . wherever you turn , there be another cluster of tree and another sculpture , and it seem as if you will never come to the end of it . we see a small white entrance to a boxy structure . I assume it would be fill with the kind of heavy abstract modern sculpture that I don & rsquo ; t have patience for . but we walk in anyway . & nbsp ; it be a small white marble room , ring with bench . there be a square opening at the top , and when I look up at it , I be blind by the glare of the sun high in the sky . Oren walk across the empty space , sit down on the bench , and tilt his head back . I follow and sit down next to he as he put his foot on the bench and stretch out his long leg . I glance around to see if there be a sign forbid this & ndash ; we have be kick out of so many other spot around the museum before . but there be nothing . I follow his gaze upward and see that from the side we be on , the square frame a perfectly blue piece of sky , dot with white wisp . this description doesn & rsquo ; t do justice to the purity of the image . it be a brilliant exhibit , and there be no way you could look at it without be entrance by the beauty of the sky . I glance at Oren lie there , so sweet and relaxed , and I stretch out myself , my head next to his , look into that patch of blue & ndash ; and we drift off to sleep . & nbsp ; we be suddenly awaken by a large and stern guard . I sit up instantly , feel startled but unusually rest . the problem wasn & rsquo ; t that we have our leg on the bench ; it be that the museum be close . & nbsp ; Oren understand and be ready to leave . & nbsp ; we walk slowly along the gravel path with the other straggler . & nbsp ; as I look at Oren walk alongside the reflect pool just outside the exit , the sun glitter on the water and I see that I have not lose he & ndash ; and that I would never lose he . & nbsp ; ",‘dies irae’ - a short story

"& lsquo ; I want to express the very bizarre and extreme reality of these trip , what it & rsquo ; s really like to be there at that age , & rdquo ; say Asaf Saban , the writer / director of Delegation , a new feature film that open on Thursday and look at teen on a high - school class trip to Poland , where they visit death camp & ndash ; a quintessentially israeli rite of passage . Saban know that make a dramatic film about the reality of such trip , rather than the ideal , would not be easy . but he have create a thoughtful , compelling film , well - write and well act , that illuminate the complexity of one of these trip in the & rsquo ; 90 . & nbsp ; it neither sentimentalize the character & rsquo ; emotion nor condemn the teen for just be teen . he do that through create several quirky , relatable character , among they Frisch ( Yoav Bavly , ) a sensitive guy , who have a crush on Nitzan ( Naomi Harari , ) an ostensibly relaxed , confident girl . but Nitzan be more troubled than she seem , and the trip bring out strange emotion in she , which cause she to take an action on one of the concentration camp tour that be very human but obviously wrong . Ido ( Leib Levin ) be a brash extrovert focus on usual teen concern like girl and drinking , and doesn & rsquo ; t suddenly become an altruist in Poland . delegation spotlight how there be some manipulation build into these trip , as the teen have group discussion in which they be encourage to show emotion , the more intense the well . the difficulty create by this be illustrate by the character of Yosef ( Ezra Dagan , in a heartrende performance , ) and Frisch & rsquo ; s grandfather . he be a survivor who accompany the class . & nbsp ; as the grandfather begin tell his personal story to the group , he speak charmingly and engagingly about his life and experience as a child before his family be deport . but it & rsquo ; s ramble , contain a great deal of personal detail , and isn & rsquo ; t what the group leader ( Alma Dishy ) want to hear . she be portray not as a villain but as a cog in a system design to elicit a particular set of reaction : tear at the horror and pride in the State of Israel . & nbsp ; in one of the film & rsquo ; s most moving scene , she take the survivor aside and he admit that he know he hasn & rsquo ; t be say what the student need to hear . & ldquo ; I get it . you want I to get to the action more quickly , & rdquo ; he say . as the film go on , he be overwhelmed by emotion and can & rsquo ; t & ldquo ; get to the action . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Prize winningIt be not surprising that Saban & rsquo ; s complex , multi - layered script win the Anat Pirchi Best Screenplay Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival last year , or that his cast take the Best Ensemble Award there . and it & rsquo ; s particularly hearten that the film receive recognition in Poland , where it win a special award at the Warsaw Film Festival . & nbsp ; the film be inspire by Saban & rsquo ; s own experience on such a trip year ago . & ldquo ; it be the first time I be abroad without my parent . that & rsquo ; s an important detail , & rdquo ; he say . & ldquo ; there be something festive about be abroad . I remember the excitement and my wish , and I think this be characteristic of young people that age , regardless , whether they be israeli or not , whether it be a Holocaust trip or not , to experience something great . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the reality for I be that I remember the trip in fragment , and I remember feel that I didn & rsquo ; t respond in the way I be mean to . I don & rsquo ; t remember much about the historical site . I have many meaningless memory of small moment . I think this be what characterize we as human being , the gap between the expectation and what we really take away from the experience . & rdquo ; he say he wasn & rsquo ; t interested in debate whether the trip be worthwhile or question the motivation of the student who take they . & ldquo ; before you place a lot of political and sociological interpretation on they , the reality of these trip be that they be a very extreme and weird experience . & ldquo ; as weird as they be , these trip be the ultimate normative experience for israeli teen . it & rsquo ; s a dissonance that be fascinating for I , because it say a lot . I want to look at it and give more weight to the subtext . People go into this territory with a lot of expectation and preconceived opinion that be all express with an exclamation point . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; for I , it be very important to speak quietly , with sensitivity and to direct the viewer & rsquo ; s glance to the nuance and ask question , and not necessarily give answer . I want to replace the exclamation point with question mark . & rdquo ; he always keep in mind the importance of the reality of the Holocaust and to treat it with respect , not to exploit it for drama . & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s something that I as a filmmaker be very sensitive to , & rdquo ; he say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s an ethical question . how do you create a drama in such place [ where the Holocaust take place ] ? you can manipulate the viewer emotionally , by use imagery and use the Holocaust as a drama in the background to elicit emotion , in way that be too easy . and the dilemma I feel as a filmmaker mirror what the student go through there . & rdquo ; Saban make a point of create & ldquo ; very typical character , who be deal with small , ordinary problem . my challenge be to shift the attention to the detail and dynamic among these character in the present , when in the background you have the great drama , not just in jewish history , but in the history of humanity . & rdquo ; speak about the character of the grandfather who be not encourage to express his story fully and in depth , he say , & ldquo ; I think he want to succeed . he want to perform his role in the way that be expect of he . he have the will to do it , but not the ability . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Saban say that the tough task for he be to put aside his perspective as an adult and recapture the feeling of what it be like to be in Poland and at the death camp at age 17 . & nbsp ; but with Yosef , he allow himself to look at the experience with the eye of a more mature person . & ldquo ; there be a similarity between how I want to tell the story of the student in the film and how Yosef want to tell his story . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; when a sheepish Yosef admit to the teacher that he know he isn & rsquo ; t get to & ldquo ; the action & rdquo ; & ndash ; the horror & ndash ; quickly enough and will try to do well , that sentence express something that Saban be also grapple with . & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m also say to the viewer , you come to this with expectation , but maybe you win & rsquo ; t get the action in the place you expect , at the volume that you & rsquo ; re expect to hear . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; with the character of Yosef , he be the storyteller , but he isn & rsquo ; t the storyteller you expect . the fact that he fail and can & rsquo ; t finish his task in the way that be expect of he & ndash ; that be the deep and true proof of his authenticity , of the authenticity of his experience and his feeling . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I think that & rsquo ; s life . People like Anne Frank and Etty Hillesum succeed in express their humanity in the context of their personal experience , and that & rsquo ; s what create the drama of their story . that & rsquo ; s why you remember they . & rdquo ;",israeli director tackles film about a class trip to poland

"around the Gaza Strip , the morning of the second day of Operation Shield and Arrow begin quietly . community be tell to either go to shelter or remain close by . I drive south from Jerusalem , a drive that take about an hour and a half . the police and army have close off some area around the Strip . traffic from Ashkelon be block to Sderot , as these area be expect to be under direct threat , which extend dozen of kilometer inland . when I arrive on the border , it be still quiet , without much traffic . there be still industry operate around the border , so there be many people who have to use the road . I have be in this area many time before during numerous conflict over the last two decade . Most of the landscape be field , and there be a few soldier who have set up a checkpoint south of Ashkelon near Yad Mordechai and the turnoff to Karmiya . I drive out toward Karmiya and Zikim Beach until there be more roadblock . then I pause and wonder what would come next . the radio say people could leave their shelter . Israel have carry out strike against site in Khan Yunis and Beit Lahiya . I could see smoke rise from Beit Lahiya . as I begin to drive back towards a hill that overlook the border area , I could see streak of white smoke rise from Gaza . these be the telltale sign of rocket . soon , Iron Dome be at work overhead , its Tamir interceptor missile fly toward the rocket . the rocket fire beginsthis be just the opening salvo of a long series of salvos that pour missile over our head . it begin at 1 : 27 p . m . and continue at 1 : 30 p . m . , 1 : 35 p . m . and every five or 10 minute after that until a brief lull at 2 : 30 p . m . , before restart around 3 p . m . , when more rocket be fire toward area south of Tel Aviv . the rocket be intercept by Iron Dome in dozen of interception . each of these salvos and the interceptor head toward they could be see from area south of Ashkelon . the rocket fire be concentrate here . smoke fill the sky and slowly drift away with each round of interception . some rocket fall in open area nearby , and smoke rise from the field . idf air defense be see intercept rocket fire from Gaza into Israel , on May 10 , 2023 ( video credit : Seth J . Frantzman ) inside Gaza , loud boom indicate that Israel be respond . the radio continue to say where the siren be sound and to encourage people to go to their shelter . in many area along the road , there be no shelter , so car have to brave the road south of Ashkelon with nothing more to do than keep drive . the number of salvos in broad daylight take place as they have in the past . however , stand under the missile fire from Gaza and the Iron Dome interceptor be still jarring . there be siren in the distance , but in some area , there be no siren , and therefore you can be stand outside and suddenly see small bright light tail by smoke rise into the area from Iron Dome interceptor head to stop the missile . as the afternoon continue , it appear that Islamic Jihad begin to use its long - range rocket , fire they toward area in the center of the country , such as Rishon Lezion , as well as other area , such as Netivot . border area be spare some of the rocket , as they fly high up in the air , way above the few resident who remain near the border . nevertheless , for many of those work industry near the border , or live in the large town such as Sderot , there be nowhere to go . Most of they be use to the situation . truck continue to go back and forth from industrial area , and civilian continue to drive on the most essential road . I drive over to the industrial area south of Ashkelon , where several road stretch into the distance , toward the sea , the Rutenberg Power Station and Zikim Beach . as I drive , I could hear siren , and the radio be say there be rocket head for Ashkelon . the loud scream of Iron Dome interceptor grasp upward lead I to look toward the coast , where the battle overhead be take place between Islamic Jihad rocket and Iron Dome . the interceptor do their work . I try to get a well vantage point , but there be roadblock . I know this area well because I & rsquo ; ve cover war here since 2009 & rsquo ; s Operation Cast Lead . the name of the operation fade with time & ndash ; Pillar of Defense , Defensive Edge , Black Belt , Guardian of the Walls , Breaking Dawn . it have be two year since Guardian begin in this same area . it be back in 2014 that Hamas try to infiltrate terrorist near here in the dune near Zikim . and in September 2014 , Avera Mengistu , an israeli man , cross into Gaza near here and be still be hold by Hamas . I think of those experience as I drive back toward Ashkelon . the overall sense be that we & rsquo ; ve be here before . this time , the local authority and home front be quick to encourage people to go into shelter , and child be mostly move from small border community , while adult stay home from work in the city . in Ashkelon , the mall be close , for instance . Most of the street be quiet . Most playground be empty , except one that have two kid and their father on it . the rocket have peak in the early afternoon , and then there be several more salvos through sunset , when rumor of a ceasefire seem to encourage Islamic Jihad to fire wildly at city far from Gaza . Israel & rsquo ; s operation against the terrorist group continue frequently , but it & rsquo ; s unclear if this have become routine & ndash ; a choreographed series of event where a ceasefire will result , but both side know the next round be soon . the radio program play as I drive back to Jerusalem all seem cynical ; it be only a matter of time until the next round of rocket and airstrike .",on the gaza border: rockets fly over israelis' heads - reporter's notebook

Netanyahu should have keep his objection private , but essentially he be correct that the vote be bad for Israel , Sa & rsquo ; ar say . the issue here be one of style , he explain . Netanyahu have & ldquo ; to know how to stand strong with friend , but to do it when it be essential , and to do it in a respectful way , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar say . he himself have a long history of stand on principle and be one of the group of what be know as the & ldquo ; Likud rebel & rdquo ; who oppose former prime minister Ariel Sharon & rsquo ; s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and the destruction of the 21 settlement there .

"for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the event of the past week in Jerusalem have be both a blessing and a curse . on the one hand , he manage to get Israel into trouble with many country by portray it as the & ldquo ; aggressor . & rdquo ; on the other hand , what happen at al - Aqsa Mosque compound ( Temple Mount ) have embolden his rival in Hamas and other extremist group , show that they have more influence and support in Jerusalem than the PA or Jordan . the violence that erupt at the Temple Mount last Friday bring the israeli - palestinian conflict back to the center of the world & rsquo ; s attention , which have be almost entirely focused on the russian invasion of Ukraine since February . this come as good news for Abbas . since the Ukraine war begin , palestinian official in Ramallah have be work hard to redirect the international community & rsquo ; s attention toward the israeli - palestinian conflict . their major concern be that Israel would exploit the world & rsquo ; s preoccupation with the war to impose new fact on the ground , especially in Jerusalem and its islamic holy site . but in the past week these official have express satisfaction with the wide coverage the violence in Jerusalem receive in the international medium . Abbas and his aide be even more delighted to see the large number of condemnation of Israel , in particular those come from arab and islamic country . US Secretary of State Antony Blinken & rsquo ; s phone call to his jordanian counterpart , during which he & ldquo ; emphasize the importance of uphold the historic status quo at the Haram al - Sharif / Temple Mount , & rdquo ; be also receive with deep satisfaction in Ramallah and Amman . Abbas be also happy to receive a phone call from Blinken with a similar message . ever since the resumption of jewish visit to the Temple Mount several year ago , the PA leadership have be accuse Israel of waging & ldquo ; religious war & rdquo ; on the Muslims . the accusation , which continue to this day , aim to rally as many Arabs and Muslims as possible against Israel . the visit of the Jews be portray by palestinian and jordanian official and media outlet as violent incursion by extremist settler under the protection of the Israel Police . yet , the allegation fail to achieve their goal , as the reaction of most Arabs and Muslims have remain limited to lip service . scene of Palestinians burn flag and photo of arab leader engage in normalization with Israel manage to enrage many Arabs , especially those reside in the Gulf state . those Arabs be far enrage when they see Palestinians curse and harass Emirati and bahraini visitor to the Temple Mount . the Abraham Accords , which be sign between Israel and a number of arab country , as well as the apparent rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia , leave the Palestinians with the impression that the Arabs and Muslims do not really care about Israel & rsquo ; s ostensible scheme to change the status quo at the Temple Mount by allocate time and space for jewish prayer there . that & rsquo ; s why palestinian official in Ramallah be please this week to see the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain and Saudi Arabia condemn & ldquo ; the Israel Police & rsquo ; s storming of al - Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; these official , however , be aware that the UAE and Bahrain be not go to take drastic measure , such as recall their ambassador from Israel . by contrast , the PA leadership appear to be content with the crisis that erupt this week between Israel and Jordan in the aftermath of the violence at the Temple Mount . since the beginning of the tension at the holy site , the PA and Jordan have be hold intensive discussion on & ldquo ; defend & rdquo ; al - Aqsa Mosque and & ldquo ; thwarting & rdquo ; Israel & rsquo ; s allege attempt to alter the status quo . the feeling in Ramallah be that the Jordanians be the only one who be side with the Palestinians . & ldquo ; the State of Palestine commend the courageous jordanian stance express by King Abdullah of Jordan and the jordanian government , parliament and people in defend Jerusalem and the christian and islamic holy site , & rdquo ; the PA say in a statement issue by its foreign ministry . & ldquo ; the State of Palestine and its people highly appreciate the diplomatic activity lead by King Abdullah to expose the israeli aggression on al - Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; the PA and Jordan , nonetheless , have good reason to be worried about the event of the past week . the violence that erupt at the Temple Mount have show that Ramallah and Amman have little influence , if any , over the young man and woman who clash with the israeli security force . the Jordanian - control Wakf islamic religious trust , which be responsible for administer the islamic holy site in Jerusalem , fail to stop dozen of rioter from enter the mosque with stone and firework . the Wakf have dozen of security guard station at the Temple Mount , but they do not intervene to stop the rioter and thug from sneak into the mosque . similarly , the PA , which have its own supporter and representative at the Temple Mount , do not do anything to stop the rioter from storm into al - Aqsa Mosque with a large cache of stone and other object . on the eve of Ramadan , some israeli and US official approach the PA and Jordan and ask they to work toward prevent an outbreak of violence in Jerusalem , particularly the Temple Mount . but instead of appeal for calm , Ramallah and Amman ramp up their rhetorical attack on Israel , warn that allow Jews to enter the Temple Mount would ignite & ldquo ; religious war & rdquo ; and plunge the entire region into a fresh cycle of violence . the PA and Jordan do not feel comfortable admit that supporter of Hamas and other extremist group be the one who call the shot at the Temple Mount . it & rsquo ; s easy for Ramallah and Amman to hold Israel solely responsible for the violence than denounce the rioter who desecrate al - Aqsa Mosque . in fact , the PA and Jordan seem to have score a diplomatic and propaganda achievement by convince many in the international community that it be Israel that plan and initiate the violence . while the violence seem to have serve Abbas & rsquo ; s goal of shift the blame toward Israel , he nevertheless appear worried that he be exclude from the first stage of the mediation effort to restore calm . instead of talk to Abbas , the Egyptians , Qataris and the United Nations choose to negotiate with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who be base in Qatar . accord to palestinian source , Abbas be & ldquo ; furious & rdquo ; for be sideline by the mediator , mainly because this allow Hamas to score more point with the palestinian public and gain more legitimacy in the international arena . Abdullah , for his part , be worried that the violence at the Temple Mount and the rise tension with Israel could cost the Hashemites their status as custodian of the islamic and christian holy site in Jerusalem . he be well aware that palestinian teenager hurl stone at israeli police officer have more influence than his Wakf in Jerusalem . but that do not mean that the monarch be prepared to walk away from the city . in recent year , report have surface that Israel may allow Saudi Arabia and other arab and islamic country to replace the Hashemites as the sole custodian of the holy site . the report be say to have anger Abdullah , who have since be make a huge effort to reassert the royal family & rsquo ; s role in tend the islamic and christian holy site in Jerusalem . he do not seem to be worry if Hamas present itself as the & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of Jerusalem , as long as that do not affect the Hashemites & rsquo ; status as & ldquo ; custodian & rdquo ; of the holy site . like Abbas , Abdullah be also worried about the increase role Hamas and other islamist group be play at the Temple Mount . video and photo feature rioter wrap in Hamas flag and chant slogan in support of Hamas arch - terrorist Mohammed Deif over the past week have undoubtedly leave Abdullah perturb . still , he do not seem to be worry if Hamas present itself as the & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of Jerusalem , as long as that do not affect the Hashemites & rsquo ; status as & ldquo ; custodian & rdquo ; of the holy site . in Ramallah , PA official be also unhappy to see the Hamas supporter lead the riot . THERE & rsquo ; S no doubt that the inflammatory statement that come from Ramallah and Amman before and during the event of the past week serve the interest of Hamas and other extremist in orchestrate the riot at the Temple Mount . Abbas and Abdullah would have be happy to see the rioter raise their photo ; instead , they get Hamas banner and flag , and be force to watch and hear Palestinians call on the Gaza - base terrorist group to fire rocket at Israel . now , it appear that Abbas and Abdullah be desperately try to extinguish the very fire they help ignite , not out of concern for Israel & rsquo ; s security , but out of fear of be totally remove from the holy site . but because they don & rsquo ; t dare to speak out against the young man and woman who have turn al - Aqsa Mosque into a battlefield and spoil the Ramadan celebration and prayer for hundred of thousand of muslim worshipper , the current strategy of the PA and Jordan be to get the international community to exert pressure on Israel to halt jewish & ldquo ; provocation . & rdquo ; even if the situation do calm down after Ramadan end ( as expect ) , it & rsquo ; s evident that the status quo have indeed shift at the Temple Mount . but it & rsquo ; s not Israel that have change the status quo ; rather , it & rsquo ; s the shabab ( youth ) and Hamas who have manage to create a new reality in which they be now the & ldquo ; custodian & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of al - Aqsa Mosque . & bull ;",temple mount tensions further embolden hamas
"Hamas , through a senior official , state its readiness to enter a cease - fire of five year or more with Israel and transition into a political entity if an independent palestinian state be establish along pre - 1967 border . the official , Khalil al - Hayya , consider Sinwar & rsquo ; s right hand , express these view during a recent interview amidst stall cease - fire negotiation . & nbsp ; Al - Hayya indicate this would only be a temporary stance until Palestinians retain their & ldquo ; historic right to all palestinian land . & rdquo ; the palestinian politician suggest Hamas ' willingness to join the Palestine Liberation Organization and form a unified government for Gaza and the West Bank and the dissolution of its military wing . despite the devastation cause by recent hostility , Al - Hayya dismiss israeli attempt to eradicate Hamas but speak about a possible truce soon . & nbsp ; Dr . Ghassan Khatib , a lecturer at Birzeit & rsquo ; s University and former minister of labor for the Palestinian Authority , provide his perspective to the Media Line . "" it be worth wait to see if this statement reflect a significant shift , "" he note , highlight a common inconsistency between individual remark by Hamas leader and the group 's official stance . Dr . Khatib far explain the internal dynamic within Hamas : "" the statement can also reflect dissent and the debate within Hamas . different leader have different view , but it could also be a tactic , consider the imminent threat of the israeli army to enter Rafah . "" & nbsp ; he add that while the promise to dissolve the military wing and pursue a sovereign state be notable , "" Hamas be willing to put its gun down isn & rsquo ; t something you hear every day . dissolve the military wing of Hamas and fall in line with a Sovereign palestinian State on the 1967 border would bring a powerful change . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; whatever the reason they make this statement now , it & rsquo ; s important to dialogue with Hamas because they be a very relevant part of palestinian internal politic . whether the Israelis like it or not , that & rsquo ; s the fact . even if the statement make by Al - Hayya have condition unlikely to be accept by Israel , it be important to continue the dialogue , and this be also true for America and other western country , & rdquo ; he conclude . natural skepticismwhile Dr . Khatib emphasize the importance of dialogue with Hamas despite skepticism about their intention , some suggest a more cautious perspective , question the sincerity of Hamas ' statement and suggest that their motive may be influence by the immediate threat of israeli military action .

"Hamas and a number of palestinian armed group vow on Monday to avenge the death of five gunman kill by israeli security force during a raid on Aqbat Jaber Refugee Camp , locate on the outskirt of Jericho . the five , identify by Hamas as Malek Lafi , 22 , Ra & rsquo ; fat Oweidat , 21 , Ibrahim Oweidat , 27 , Thaer Oweidat , 28 , and Adham Oweidat , 22 , belong to the group & rsquo ; s armed wing , Izaddin al - Qassam . palestinian source say the gunman operate in the camp under the name of a group call Aqbat Jaber Camp Battalion . a new armed palestinian gunman group have form in JerichoThe new group , the first of its kind in the Jericho area , be see by the source as part of an attempt to imitate similar militia that have be operate in the northern West Bank over the past year : Jenin Battalion , Nablus Battalion and Balata Refugee Camp Battalion , as well as the Lions & rsquo ; Den and Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades . while these group consist mostly of member of palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) and the rule Fatah faction head by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the slain Aqbat Jaber cell member all belong to Hamas . two of the gunman be involve in a shooting attack on January 28 against an Israeli - own caf & eacute ; at Almog junction , locate only a few kilometer away from Aqbat Jaber Refugee Camp . no one be hurt . since the attack , the IDF have impose strict security measure in the Jericho area , a move that badly hurt the local economy , which rely mainly on local tourism . the camp be locate across the street from the Oasis Casino , the first gambling facility in the West Bank . the casino have be shut since the start of the second Intifada more than 20 year ago . some of the camp resident previously work in the casino and a nearby hotel . last year , unconfirmed report claim that Israel and the Palestinians be discuss the possibility of allow the casino to reopen . the report revive hope in Aqbat Jaber camp in particular and Jericho in general that the local economy would be strengthen once the gambler , most of whom be israeli citizen , return to the casino . despite the closure of the casino , Jericho have over the past few year witness an unprecedented boom in local tourism as dozen of luxurious villa have pop up in and around the city . in addition , many foreign tourist have return to the city in recent year . the villa , own by arab Israelis and resident of east Jerusalem , be offer for rent on a daily , weekly and monthly basis .

"in his first interview in hebrew media since the outbreak of war , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insinuate that threat by protester against his government & rsquo ; s judicial reform to stop serve in the IDF reserve play a part in Hamas & rsquo ; s decision to attack Israel on October 7 . & ldquo ; the refusal [ to serve ] be a disaster & ndash ; and create illusion for our enemy , & rdquo ; the prime minister say during the interview on Channel 14 . Netanyahu also criticize current protester call for an election . & ldquo ; I say to the protester & ndash ; get it together . this be the time for unity , this be the time for greatness . their goal be to bring down the government , and every time their excuse be different . I do not think that it reflect a majority of the people . I turn to the majority of the people and say & ndash ; this be the time for unity , & rdquo ; the prime minister say . address the four different warning by the IDF during the period of the judicial reform that the social upheaval they have create be a danger to national security , Netanyahu say he himself have make similar warning in real time and do not need the IDF warning to tell he that . the prime minister add that the IDF assessment prior to October 7 be that Hamas be & ldquo ; deter , and therefore he be unaware of the threat of the massacre . Netanyahu add that while he believe that every person who be in a position of authority on October 7 bare & ldquo ; some responsibility , & rdquo ; now be not the time to form a national committee of investigation , since it would & ldquo ; add to the [ heavy ] load & rdquo ; of run the war .

Gantz and Eisenkot say that they have decide to depart after the prime minister begin take into account personal political consideration while make decision regard the war . & ldquo ; Gantz and Eisenkot do something that be not do & ndash ; leave the government in war time , & rdquo ; Netanyahu say . ask about their claim , the prime minister respond , & ldquo ; and they do not have political consideration ? my consideration be to ensure the safety of Israel . & rdquo ; Netanyahu invite other party currently in the opposition to join the government in Gantz and Eisenkot & rsquo ; s place . in an odd moment in the interview , Netanyahu repeat a misleading claim that the bill to draft haredim into the IDF that be currently be process in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee ( FADC ) will bring & ldquo ; many thousand & rdquo ; of haredi man into the IDF . the bill , as it currently stand , include a gradual increase of haredi draftee per year , from the current 1 , 000 or so per year to approximately 35 % of each graduate class & ndash ; roughly 5 , 000 man & ndash ; per year in 2036 . the number would not rise significantly in the come year , and the sanction for haredi yeshivot that do not meet their quota be direct against the yeshivot themselves but not at the individual who avoid the draft . this be widely regard as insufficient to lead to real change . Netanyahu say that he expect opposition leader MK Yair Lapid and Gantz to support the bill , as it pass its first reading under their government in 2022 . however , a significant portion of Knesset member from Netanyahu & rsquo ; s own Likud party , the entire opposition , and the Defense Ministry have all say that the law be no long relevant to the IDF & rsquo ; s need post October 7 . Netanyahu & rsquo ; s remark on the haredi bill be surprising , as many member of the Likud , include those who have not express opposition to the bill as it currently stand , have say that it be only a preliminary version . this lead to widespread belief that Netanyahu himself be open to a more sweeping version of the bill , close to what many see as the bare minimum to meet the IDF & rsquo ; s need & ndash ; to reach a 50 % draft rate of haredi man within five year . the haredi party be unlikely to accept such a version of the bill , and may opt to attempt to topple the government rather than pass it . the issue of the haredi draft be thus view as a litmus test for the prime minister & ndash ; whether he act in the national interest or give preference to the survival of his coalition . & nbsp ;","judicial reform protesters partly to blame for hamas massacre, netanyahu hints"

Africa ? we win & rsquo ; t allow anyone to fool we . this be nonsense . where be [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu ? Netanyahu , may God prolong his life , be still the prime minister . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas say that the Palestinians be ready to hold the election once Israel agree to allow the vote to take place in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we want the election to take place in Jerusalem , and not in Abu Dis , & rdquo ; he say , refer to a West Bank village south of Jerusalem . & ldquo ; for we , the election be not a tactic or a game . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas say that the EU make a big effort to exert pressure on Israel to allow the election to take place in Jerusalem , but to no avail . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; when we announce the election , the Europeans tell we that they support we and be ready to help we achieve our goal , & rdquo ; he note . & ldquo ; I tell the Europeans that that Israel will not agree to hold the election in Jerusalem . they tell I that they will talk to the Israelis about this . we also ask the Americans where be they , but we didn & rsquo ; t hear from they . we wait and didn & rsquo ; t receive a response . we also send our foreign minister to Europe to tell they we be run out of time . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; accord to Abbas , the head of the EU tell he that they be & ldquo ; frustrated & rdquo ; by Israel & rsquo ; s refusal to respond to the request to hold the election in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Abbas accuse Israel of & ldquo ; beating & rdquo ; palestinian candidate in Jerusalem and prevent election gathering . & nbsp ; he go on to praise the resident of east Jerusalem for protest israeli security restriction in the city in the past three week . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I want to praise the great stance of our people in Jerusalem and the arab people who stand with we regard the event in Jerusalem in the past few week , & rdquo ; Abbas say . & ldquo ; there be a great people in Jerusalem capable of say no to the occupation . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; he accuse the israeli government of support jewish extremist who chant & quot ; death to the Arabs & quot ; during a recent demonstration near the Old City of Jerusalem . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; refer to the removal of the police barricade from Damascus Gate & ndash ; which reportedly trigger the clash in the city & ndash ; Abbas say : & ldquo ; Jerusalem belong to we ; our brother manage to remove the barricade that prevent they from move and work in the city . they launch a peaceful , popular resistance . this be the only way to confront this aggression on our people . Jerusalem be the eternal capital of Palestine . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; early this week , Foreign Ministry political adviser Alon Bar tell european ambassador that Israel be not interfere with the schedule palestinian election . & ldquo ; Israel will not prevent the election in the Palestinian Authority from happen , & rdquo ; Bar say . the palestinian election be an internal palestinian matter , and Israel will not intervene , he add . & nbsp ; Hamas official say they do not participate in the meeting of the faction leader because they receive an invitation only at the last minute . & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s position be clear : we reject the postponement of the election and we will not provide a cover for such a decision , & rdquo ; say Mohammed Subha , a spokesperson for the Hamas electoral list & ldquo ; Jerusalem be our Destiny . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Subha warn that postponement of the election would have a negative impact on effort to end the rivalry between Hamas and Fatah . he also hint that the move could trigger widespread protest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . & nbsp ; hour before the meeting , thousand of Palestinians demonstrate in the Gaza Strip to voice opposition to the cancellation of the election . & nbsp ; some of the protest be organize by supporter of exile Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan , an archrival of Abbas . Dahlan loyalist have form an electoral list call Al - Mustaqbal ( Future ) to contest the parliamentary election . & nbsp ; Nayrouz Qarmout , a spokeswoman for Al - Mustaqbal , point out that 25 electoral list run in the parliamentary election be oppose to the cancellation of the vote . & ldquo ; no one have the right to postpone the election , & rdquo ; she say . & ldquo ; only those who be afraid of the result don & rsquo ; t want election . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Qarmout and other Palestinians predict that the cancellation of the election would intensify the dispute between Fatah and Hamas . & nbsp ; in a joint statement , the electoral list warn that the cancellation of the election would be a & ldquo ; constitutional crime . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the cancellation of the election be a new and big catastrophe for the Palestinians , & rdquo ; say Abdel Hakim Awad , a senior official with Dahlan & rsquo ; s Democratic Reform Current movement . & ldquo ; it will have dire effect and serious consequence on the palestinian people . the election be a light at the end of the tunnel in order to unify the palestinian people and end the division [ between the West Bank and Gaza Strip ] . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; the decision to hold the election be part of an agreement reach between Fatah , Hamas and 12 other palestinian faction . & nbsp ; the agreement , reach under the auspex of Egypt , call for boost public freedom in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , include the immediate release of detainee hold by the PA and Hamas and non - interference by the palestinian security force in the electoral process . & nbsp ; the agreement be reach after month of negotiation , which begin in July 2020 between Fatah and Hamas leader in Turkey , Qatar and Egypt . & nbsp ; in accordance with the agreement , Abbas issue a decree on January 15 for hold the first general election since 2006 , when Hamas win the parliamentary vote . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the palestinian people in Jerusalem and all constituency of the nation be invite to general , free and direct election to elect member of the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) on May 22 , 2021 and President of the State of Palestine on July 31 , 2021 , & rdquo ; Abbas say in the decree . & nbsp ; accord to the decree , the PLC election shall be consider the first stage for the election of the Palestinian National Council ( PNC ) , the PLO & rsquo ; s legislative body . the formation of the PNC shall be complete on August 31 , 2021 . & nbsp ; the palestinian Central Elections Commission say that 36 electoral list submit their nomination application for the PLC election , include 29 independent list and seven from political party . the number of candidate nominate for the 132 - member PLC reach 1 , 391 , include 405 woman .",abbas: palestinian elections postponed after israel blocks jerusalem vote
"& nbsp ; on April 7 , 2011 , a new era begin for Israel & rsquo ; s air and missile defense force & ndash ; when the Iron Dome missile defense system complete its first successful operational interception against a short - range threat originate from the Gaza Strip . & nbsp ; now , one decade later , it be time to analyze the decision - make process behind the system & rsquo ; s development , some lesson learn from a decade of operation , and the prospect for further advancement and adaptation over the next decade , include potential future connection with laser solution . & nbsp ; Iron Dome & rsquo ; s unrivaled success on the battlefield & ndash ; which have even make it , in many people & rsquo ; s eye , the most important israeli innovation in the country & rsquo ; s 70 year of existence & ndash ; have produce countless article , interview , book and television program on the path to develop the system and its progress over the year . & nbsp ; for the sake of history , those who make the decision and develop the system , and for the purpose of draw effective lesson for the future , it be essential that the record be set straight , and that the factual truth , albeit subjective , be know , as it primarily appear in the State Comptroller & rsquo ; s report 59a . & nbsp ; decide to develop Iron Dome & nbsp ; in 1996 , Israel and the United States agree to collaborate on Project THEL ( Tactical High - Energy Laser ) , mistakenly dub Nautilus ( America & rsquo ; s early adventure in this technological field ) . from the start , the project be develop as a technological demonstrator . in 2001 , a series of test be complete prove a laser beam can intercept a threat , but conclude that a chemical laser - base interception system be not suitable for operational deployment in Israel . low operational preparedness ( technological reliability ) , complex logistic ( size , availability , repair and transfer from site to site ) and environmental concern be only a few of the many significant reason why . & nbsp ; Israel and the US decide to plan another system , small and more portable , name MTHEL ( Mobile THEL ) . from this decision , it can be understand that the cessation of the THEL program be not in any way cause by Israel & rsquo ; s exit from Lebanon , as some have argue . & nbsp ; from 2001 to 2005 , Israel and its american counterpart work on the new collaboration but decide to discontinue it in 2005 while still in the planning stage , as per advice from the Defense Ministry & rsquo ; s Directorate of Defense Research and Development ( DDR & amp ; D ) director Shmuel Keren and assessment share by numerous expert . it be believe this project would not lead to an operational weapon system give that there be no foreseeable future for a chemical laser - base system . it be clear that any future laser - base interception system would be base on a solid - state laser , but such technology would not be available for & ndash ; what prove to be optimistic & ndash ; at least another decade . & nbsp ; in the end , by 2005 , after roughly nine year of work and $ 600 million ( mostly fund by the US ) , the outcome be a technological demonstrator , impossible to duplicate or be use operationally on an american test field . over the year , a series of interception test be conduct on the system with an actual success rate of less than 50 % ( base on american official datum ) . & nbsp ; additionally , a detailed on - paper plan be design for a small mobile system , MTHE . the idea , later dub SKYGUARD , be not yet create . SKYGUARD & rsquo ; s status can also be deduce from a Northrop Grumman ( NG ) proposal submit to DDR & amp ; d down the road . the proposal require high development cost than all of Iron Dome & rsquo ; s development from zero . statement contend that the THEL system could have be bring to Israel and operationalize , or that the MTHEL / SKYGUARD system be ready for production in 2005 be simply not factually accurate nor base in reality . this remain the case today , 15 year later . & nbsp ; in 2004 & ndash ; face elevated threat , especially in southern Israel & ndash ; an interagency team be set up to draft solution for defensive system against short - range threat . this team , lead by R & amp ; d unit director Daniel Gold , issue a call for proposal and test dozen of potential solution . eventually , at the end of 2005 , the team recommend develop a system base on Rafael & rsquo ; s proposal ( with change ) & ndash ; and it be name & ldquo ; Iron Dome . & rdquo ; the proposal be approve by DDR & amp ; d director Keren and a relatively small budget be allocate , out of the department & rsquo ; s overall budget , and a partnership with Rafael that financially support part of the R & amp ; d effort . & nbsp ; in 2006 , in light of the change threat landscape & ndash ; with the Second Lebanon War and rocket launch into Israel serve as significant catalyst & ndash ; and inquiry by NG and other defense industry , Keren present the propose concept to then - defense minister Amir Peretz , recommend Iron Dome . Peretz adopt the suggestion and even call for expedite development . however , there still be not a significant budget allocate to the project , & nbsp ; in October 2006 , after additional significant pressure , Keren appoint a professional committee lead by his deputy Jacob Nagel , to test which solution would well protect Israel from short - range missile threat . the committee include dozen of internal and external expert in the field of missile , laser , operational research and doctrine . Lt . - Col . Shachar Shohat & ndash ; who later achieve the rank of brigadier - general and serve as commander of the Air Defense Forces & ndash ; serve as the Air Force representative on the committee . & nbsp ; for three month , the Nagel Committee work intensely to test all potential israeli and international solution . finally , in December , the committee present its finding and recommendation to Keren , to Defense Ministry director - general Gabi Ashkenazi and to Peretz , and they approve it . in February 2007 , these recommendation be present to prime minister Ehud Olmert , who authorize they . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s state comptroller note , & ldquo ; DDR & amp ; D , through the work of the Nagel Committee , conduct an orderly process for testing alternative , and present the alternative to different party and note the clear advantage with the Iron Dome system . each of the party & ndash ; the director - general , minister of defense , and prime minister & ndash ; approve DDR & amp ; D & rsquo ; s conclusion . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Peretz declare that the Iron Dome concept be prove , but would require additional external funding . Olmert explain that Iron Dome & rsquo ; s development be unavoidable and direct the Defense Ministry to approach the Finance Ministry to allocate the needed budget . by June 2007 the project still have not receive a substantial budget , and progress with DDR & amp ; D and Rafael R & amp ; d budget , increase by several dozen of million of shekel from Peretz and act director - general Yehiel Horev from the defense budget . & nbsp ; the Nagel Committee do not include the THEL system as a potential solution , give previous assessment cast doubt on its operational potential or relevance , and the inability to be duplicate . SKYGUARD , NG & rsquo ; s solution , be examine in detail . during the process , NG & rsquo ; s VP meet with the DDR & amp ; d director and thank he & ndash ; in writing and in person & ndash ; for the opportunity to present the proposal to the committee . & nbsp ; in 2007 , upon take office and face linger tension , defense minister Ehud Barak convene yet another hearing , call for a re - presentation of the Nagel Committee finding and recommendation on each of the propose solution , include another external presentation of the SKYGUARD system . Barak then ratify these recommendation , declare development of Iron Dome as essential , and allocate the need budget out of the Defense Ministry budget . & nbsp ; follow this approval , final negotiation be conduct with Rafael , the project be submit to the government , and it be officially approve . in December 2007 , Rafael sign a contract with the israeli government for the development and equipping of the first two Iron Dome battery . & nbsp ; from this point , development of the project be expedite by Rafael , ELTA and M - Prest under a DDR & amp ; d project team , lead by then - Lt . - Col . Chicco with the close guidance of R & amp ; d director Gold . & nbsp ; simultaneously , an unprecedented lobbying campaign for SKYGUARD kick off , draft senior retire military officer , academic and medium figure . this campaign lead to serious incitement , with personal attack lob at director - general Pinhas Buchris , DDR & amp ; d director Keren and his deputy Nagel , who be dub the & ldquo ; high - priest of Iron Dome & rdquo ; by the campaign . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; the lobby & rsquo ; s effort include draft pr expert , distribute marketing brochure , push defamation both online and in newspaper , and plan an approach to key US figure in an effort to harm the State of Israel . this be reveal in article by Channel 11 & rsquo ; s Ayala Hasson and Channel 10 & rsquo ; s Raviv Drucker . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Buchris , Keren and Nagel be at the forefront of defend the decision to develop Iron Dome , while Gold and his team be work on develop the system with the industry . they hold dozen of meeting with the leader of Israel & rsquo ; s northern and southern community , minister , mk , member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , and member of the press and academia . upon review the factual datum and decision - make process , almost every one of these individual understand that they have be feed nothing but misinformation , and withdraw their support of the lobbying campaign . & nbsp ; as part of his effort to defend the project , Buchris ( with Nagel ) travel as part of a professional delegation to the US to see the THEL system in New Mexico . they meet with representative from NG and with relevant member of the US military who explain that the decision to stop development of the project be reach in consultation with Israel . Buchris return to Israel more convinced than ever that the THEL system be not relevant , and they be completely in support of the decision - make process . & nbsp ; in 2008 , Barak meet with US secretary of defense Robert Gates , and they discuss way the US could support Israel in its attempt to protect the home front from high - trajectory missile . this be largely motivate by America & rsquo ; s desire to prevent Israel from enter a war with Gaza . as a result of these meeting , a joint committee lead by DDR & amp ; D & rsquo ; s Nagel and US Gen . Robin Rand be form to once again test each of the possible solution ( Iron Dome , SKYGUARD , Vulcan Planks and other propose laser system ) . again the conclusion be reach that only Iron Dome could sufficiently supply the defense need for Israel & rsquo ; s home front , while provide its leader the freedom to act as need . & nbsp ; the Nagel - Rand committee again determine that the SKYGUARD system , still only on paper , be not a suitable solution & ndash ; either for Israel or the US . as part of this committee , a delegation of US missile , radar , command and control , and laser expert arrive in Israel , conduct in - depth discussion and visit both DDR & amp ; D and the israeli defense industry . while the first visit start with marked skepticism surround the feasibility of develop the system , it end with admiration for the system , but with expectation that the project would not be complete on time or within budget . yet one year later during a subsequent visit , the delegation be enthral by the pace of Iron Dome & rsquo ; s development and advancement in solve technical problem . they release a professional report , optimistic on the project & rsquo ; s success and keep to the project schedule and budget . & nbsp ; the Nagel - Rand Committee recommendation be present to and subsequently approve by Keren , Buchris and Barak . they be then present to relevant american stakeholder and result in then - president Barack Obama allocate $ 205 million in special assistance to the program . a central element of the committee & rsquo ; s proposal insist that assistance be limit to equip the Iron Dome system in an effort to prevent any future potential export restriction on the system and ensure development remain & ldquo ; blue and white & rdquo ; in its entirety . & nbsp ; in the decade follow that decision , the US significantly increase its financial contribution to equip additional Iron Dome system and launcher . include in the 2016 Memorandum of understanding between the US and Israel , push by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Obama ( which enter into force in fiscal year 2019 ) , a new , special section be add allocate $ 500 million annually to ballistic missile defense , with the equipping of Iron Dome component be an important component thereof . & nbsp ; the past decade & ndash ; analysis and lesson learn & nbsp ; today , the Iron Dome missile defense system be highly regard in professional , political , military and civilian circle both in Israel and abroad , and have receive numerous prize and praise for its groundbreaking military innovation and success in save life . the term & ldquo ; Iron Dome & rdquo ; have become ingrain in the Hebrew lexicon , synonymous with incredible success . & nbsp ; despite its operational and technological success , those initial naysayer be not quick to mute themselves or their criticism . at the tactical level , Iron Dome & rsquo ; s operational capability be call into question , while at the strategic level , concern be raise that the damage outweigh any benefit , especially give the negative impact on the national - level decision - make process and international legitimization . & nbsp ; they claim that Iron Dome , with the passage of time , have become a burden rather than an asset and a double - edge sword . an academic research project conduct at the National Security College , guide by one of the author of this article , analyze Iron Dome & rsquo ; s impact on the israeli National Security Strategy & ndash ; economically , militarily , socially and politically . after a decade of operational experience and more than 2 , 500 successful interception , the research conclusively find that the Iron Dome system be a first - class asset and clear barrier breaker , not remotely resemble a double - edge sword . Iron Dome often change the decision - make process of Israel & rsquo ; s political echelon , and our enemy & rsquo ; method and tactic . & nbsp ; Iron Dome be a key element of Israel & rsquo ; s multi - layer defense array , develop to protect the home front from incoming missile threat . while Iron Dome protect against short - range threat , the David & rsquo ; s sling system defend against mid - tier threat , and the Arrow system defend against upper - tier threat . & nbsp ; the US Army , face many threat similar to Israel , decide to procure two Iron Dome battery as an interim solution while decide what the most appropriate endure solution would be for its need . simultaneously , the US Marines also express interest in the system and have conduct several successful test in America . & nbsp ; the continued collaboration between Israel and the US in the development and equipping of Iron Dome contribute to strengthen the strategic and technological collaboration between the two country and their defense of their respective civilian and service member . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; as we celebrate 10 year since Iron Dome & rsquo ; s first interception , we be remind of the importance of recall the overall goal that lead decision - maker to develop this system : & bull ; life and limb : save live above all else , almost at any cost . & bull ; strategic asset : protect strategic facility , military facility and national infrastructure . & bull ; economic defense : reduce the amount of direct and indirect economic damage ( cost of property , human casualty and injury ) and prevent interference with the economy and national gross production . & nbsp ; & bull ; strategic flexibility : provide additional option to political decision - maker by reduce the risk pose by incoming rocket . & bull ; ability to act : increase the military & rsquo ; s freedom to act via the ability to carry out offensive operation free from the fear of retaliatory rocket attack . & bull ; confidence : raise the national morale and spirit , decrease the psychological impact on the population cause by image of damage and destruction , especially in the age of social medium . & nbsp ; in - depth analysis of relevant event of the past decade lead to determination of success on several level , such as : & bull ; economic perspective : a review of the past decade & rsquo ; s economic datum prove beyond all doubt that Iron Dome certainly stand up to the economic test . this be far support with the realization that the comparison can not be between the cost of the interceptor and the cost of a missile , but rather the total cost of a launch compare to the direct and indirect economic consequence result from incoming enemy missile score direct hit . & bull ; Societal Perspective : Iron Dome , as an effective defense system , significantly contribute to Israel & rsquo ; s sense of community and national pride . it contribute to Israel & rsquo ; s degree of resilience by reduce overall level of fear and anxiety , create a unified home front with all its civilian feeling protect . in the battle over public opinion , the system also contribute to Israel & rsquo ; s story of success over the enemy and improve overall morale both during and after period of combat . however , it be also important to note that the system & rsquo ; s past success create a danger of an illusion of security to civilian . to prevent such negative surprise , it be essential that our leader set reasonable expectation for citizen . outlook for the next decade & nbsp ; over the past decade , Iron Dome provide unprecedented superiority . during the next decade , we can expect enemy will respond with technological effort of their own . all sign suggest they have already start , and thus there be no time to waste . testing , improvement and adaptation of Iron Dome be constantly require as a way to ensure it maintain its legendary superiority . this be an endless battle in the fight between the threat and the interceptor . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; without get into specific , it be clear that every system have limitation and vulnerability . however , if we do not put forth every effort to further its innovation and renewal , our adversary will detract from Iron Dome & rsquo ; s effectiveness and superiority . there be no indefinitely hermetic defensive solution . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; we can not rest on our laurel . we must consistently test the enemy & rsquo ; advancement and threat trend , and adapt our system to achieve optimal effective defense , in order to maintain relevance on the future battlefield . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; one KEY area of interest be laser - base solution . & nbsp ; during the Iron Dome decision - make process and continuously ever since , baseless allegation have be make related to the performance of laser - base system versus kinetic interception - base system use missile . & nbsp ; each solution have advantage and disadvantage that be important to raise and understand . understand the pro and con of a laser - base system be especially important today , give the great progress recently make in Israel in technology development . & nbsp ; it be critical to correct some of the factually incorrect argument in favor of transition to a laser - base system : & bull ; & ldquo ; a laser - base interception system will prevent disruption to daily life , as it be an almost perfect and hermetic system . & rdquo ; hermetic system do not exist , and it be clear that with any system , daily routine will be disrupt . in any case , the performance of the missile - base system seem to be well than those base on laser . & bull ; & ldquo ; Laser system will well handle barrage attack . & rdquo ; actually , the opposite be true and this be one of the most compelling disadvantage to a laser - base system , since such a system & rsquo ; s primary role would be to handle a series of threat . statement allege & ldquo ; interception at the speed of light & rdquo ; be mislead . while the beam can reach its target at the speed of light and notably fast than a missile , it must remain on each target for several second to destroy it ( how long can not be reveal ) and largely depend on the threat variant , the strength of the beam and its distance from the target . the laser - base system would be quite limited in its ability to counter attack salvos ( unless it could be build with multiple beam , mean another system , which would substantially increase the overall cost ) . in multi - purpose missile - base system , the missile be launch independently , be operate simultaneously by the system and operate instantaneously on the target to counter incoming threat . & bull ; & ldquo ; Laser system don & rsquo ; t require adaptation for new threat . & rdquo ; Laser - base system be not robust , and each threat need to be program for separately . & nbsp ; ON FEBRUARY 8 , 2020 , the Defense Ministry announce a groundbreaking technological achievement in the development of the solid - state laser . the depth and gravity of this achievement be noteworthy , as be its potential for strengthen Israel & rsquo ; s low tactical defensive layer capability . the correct and plan use of this new technology add to the interception capability in a new , cheap way , base on an understanding of its limitation . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; while this be a major advancement that allow for a demonstration of the system & rsquo ; s battlefield capability , the full operational range of the system be still several year and hundred of million of shekel of development away . there be no doubt that the addition of a laser interceptor , alongside the classic Iron Dome interceptor , will improve overall performance and will also be beneficial to Israel & rsquo ; s partner , include the US . & nbsp ; in SUMMARY , after a decade of operational work of the Iron Dome system , it can be say that we must tip our hat to all those who have work on this project over the past 15 year , the decision - make stage , development of the system , its integration and its transition into successful operationalization and use , through continuous improvement along the way . & nbsp ; that be say , Iron Dome be not yet complete , and it will likely continue for many year to come . our enemy be learn the system all the time and without question they never cease to try to surprise we . the role of all those involve be to always be one step ahead of they .

Maccabi look superb in its open Euroleague game against Partizan Belgrade at Yad Eliyahu on Thursday , October 5 as hope be very high that the club would once again reach the top of the continental basketball world . however , that be before October 7 occur , and Hamas & rsquo ; s attack on the jewish state set off a chain of effect that turn the former reality upside down . the yellow - and - blue have to pivot quickly as the import player and their family be fly out of the country , and after a very short break Belgrade become the club & rsquo ; s new temporary home . & ldquo ; it be a difficult year , regardless of basketball , & rdquo ; Katash begin . & ldquo ; we be citizen of the country and it have be quite an experience that we be go through . this one season feel like three or four year and in addition to what happen with my good friend and coach Lior Lubin who pass away , it be intense and very complex . every day there be something that happen and perhaps my character be sometimes a disadvantage in these situation , but maybe it be an advantage . & rdquo ; in addition to his own mental make - up , Katash reference his player & rsquo ; strength . & ldquo ; if we didn & rsquo ; t have continuity in the roster from last year , we wouldn & rsquo ; t have be able to survive this entire situation . we have a tough schedule but we be able to do it with the character of the player and build upon what we have start last season . & rdquo ; the prevail thought be that Maccabi would fall apart without its home crowd to cheer it on and a successful Euroleague campaign be at that point too lofty an expectation . but that be not the case as the player and staff pull it together and end up in seventh place with an impressive 20 - 14 record , earn it a place in the play - in . after easily dispose of Baskonia , Panathinaikos be up next for Maccabi as it take the eventual euroleague champ to five game before fall in Athens . local victorylocally , the yellow - and - blue win game after game in the domestic league throughout the winter month but end up fall in the State Cup final to Hapoel Jerusalem in a game that take place just day after the club & rsquo ; s continental campaign come to an end . & ldquo ; when you win a title it & rsquo ; s always great , but this season be extra special after everything we have experience . after we end Europe we be really do and we have so many injury and situation that we pay a price for , whether it be the war or personal issue of the player as well . after we lose the cup , the player really didn & rsquo ; t want to finish this season that way . in some way , everything go against we but we also have to look at thing in proportion as there be still hostage in Gaza . & rdquo ; Katash & rsquo ; s charge pull it all together in their league quarterfinal series against Ness Ziona , which result in a sweep that be follow up by another walkover versus Jerusalem , which be without injure star Levi Randolph ( now rumor to be come to Maccabi ) . Hapoel Tel Aviv look to avenge last year & rsquo ; s final series loss , but once again the Reds come up short and Maccabi capture yet another title . while the yellow - and - blue can bask in championship glory , the celebration will be short live as it will need to start rebuild the roster for the 24 / 25 season that be right around the corner and there will be plenty of change come , from both import to Israelis . Baldwin and Brown swiftly declare that they will be leave the team due to the war , with their announcement come as they be still on the floor celebrating . Josh Nebo & rsquo ; s contract be up and he will be depart while Bonzie Colson be still undecided as to where he will suit up next season . Baldwin , Brown and Colson all have contract for the 24 / 25 campaign with Maccabi , but the club will not stand in their way should they want to leave . Katash of course would love for they to all stay but the reality be that they will be head to other team . & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s sad to lose they and break up the team and it & rsquo ; s really sad actually . but what have occur here this season in the country , it & rsquo ; s part of the price that we have to pay . what happen on October 7 be the big incident that I & rsquo ; ve witness in my lifetime and we have to take thing into proportion . & rdquo ; Rivero should be back , and the same may be true of Antonius Cleveland , howevervjame Webb will likely be look for a new home next season . as for the israeli contingent , Rafi Menco be a free agent but should return , Josh DiBartoloemo and Jake Cohen be under contract and should be back play at Yad Eliyahu next season , while Tamir Blatt be opt out of his current contract but will most likely re - sign with the team at a high rate . the one big question be the league and final MVP , Sorkin . the big man be rumor to be head to North America to try out for NBA team after a stellar season , but there be also talk that Maccabi will make he an offer that he can & rsquo ; t refuse and he will stay yellow - and - blue for the foreseeable future . & ldquo ; Roman win every award this season , & rdquo ; Katash say . & ldquo ; I have the privilege of coach he . he can really do it all and have a huge upside and be one of the most talented player . he & rsquo ; s a great person as well and I & rsquo ; m very proud as to how he come into the playoff . he be play well in the Euroleague , but then get hurt and it just take time to get he back up to speed . he need to be a Maccabi Tel Aviv player for the rest of his career . & rdquo ; there be plenty of name that have be link to Maccabi and while the Euroleague home game will most probably be play once again in Belgrade , the club still remain a very attractive option for some player , explain the bench boss . & ldquo ; next season win & rsquo ; t be easy and it be a challenge this year just in term of scheduling . but Maccabi be a big club and have a system in place and while it win & rsquo ; t be easy to keep player and sign player , we be there . & ldquo ; we know we will lose some player but there be plenty of player who see Maccabi as an opportunity . Maccabi be a good place to play and a place where player can advance their career . & rdquo ; it seem that the yellow - and - blue be do exactly that , find player who want to come play for Maccabi that have experience Israel . those may include Hapoel Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Randolph , Hapoel Holon big man Justin Smith along with Hapoel Tel Aviv & rsquo ; s center Jaylen Hoard , to name a few . the upcoming campaign will be complex and challenge without a doubt , but the most important thing for Maccabi will be to be able to adapt on the fly and adjust as it do this season . & ldquo ; there be a lot of question mark . in this chaotic reality , it be impossible to know what the day will bring . thing change all the time , we have to adjust ourselves & ndash ; because we be head into a difficult year . & rdquo ;",katash reflects on maccabi tel aviv’s chaotic campaign

Yosef be report to have say that if there be a change from the status quo whereby exemption from military service will no long be valid , ultra - orthodox youth will leave the country in drove . as a public servant who receive his salary from the state , Yosef speak out of turn , and what he say be a form of incitement . he have since state that he be misunderstood , but to no avail . there have be call for his ouster and for the retraction of the award . there have also be demonstration against he . as have happen in the past , the question arise as to whether a person should be judge only for achievement in the category in which he or she have be name as an Israel Prize winner or whether the awarding of the prize should also be base on that person & rsquo ; s behavior and political and religious view and affiliation . empty seat on Passover at the Great Synagogue ■ one of the most demoralizing thing that could happen during a pilgrim festival , such as Passover , be to attend service at the majestic Jerusalem Great Synagogue and see that most of the seat be empty . there could be several reason for this . one be that people sleep in after the Seder , having go to bed at midnight or later . another be that , due to numerous flight cancellation , many of the thousand of evacuee transfer to Jerusalem after October 7 have return to their home , leave no tourist to replace they . yet another be the police warning follow the terrorist attack in Jerusalem just ahead of the holiday ; fear may have keep some people at home . but , as always , the inspire Great Synagogue choir , with its wide vocal range that accompany Cantor Tzvi Weiss and be conduct by Elli Jaffe , be top - notch , even though it & rsquo ; s somewhat disconcert that Weiss sing in the Ashkenazi pronunciation of Hebrew . latecomer begin to file in after the Bible reading , more so in the man & rsquo ; s section than in the woman & rsquo ; s , but there be still far too many empty seat in both . in nearby France Square , a long , symbolic Seder table have be set with artistically fold yellow paper napkin on each plate , empty wine bottle , and dead flower . each chair have a large photograph of a hostage , affix with his or her name , send a powerful message . the symbolic high chair at the head of the table , which bear the portrait of Kfir Bibas , the young of the hostage , be especially poignant . & nbsp ; the fact that the high chair be at the head of the table be reminiscent of the prophet Isaiah & rsquo ; s vision , which , in addition to include the wolf dwell with the lamb and the leopard with the young goat and the lion , speak of a small child who would lead they . & nbsp ; though each and every hostage be equally important , none have capture as much sympathy as Kfir Bibas , whose first birthday on January 18 be spend in captivity in Gaza . the venue for the symbolic Seder be appropriate in that there be synagogue within the distance of a kilometer in all direction , represent most stream of Judaism . prayer and special psalm for the hostage have be incorporate into synagogue service . Hamas 's hostage video ■ the video of Hersh Goldberg - Polin that be release by Hamas last week and the timing of the release may possibly be attribute to two factor . one be that he be a dual national , hold american and israeli citizenship , and the other be that his mother , Rachel Goldberg - Polin , be include in Time Magazine & rsquo ; s list of the 100 most influential people . Goldberg - Polin have be extremely active in the campaign by hostage family for the return of their love one to Israel . unfortunately , because the date of the video be unknown , no one know the true state of Hersh & rsquo ; s health . but what matter be that , hopefully , he & rsquo ; s alive , and unlike so many other parent who have no idea whether their son and daughter be alive , the Goldberg - Polins have at least receive a sign , and they can play the video over and over again . it be so terribly important for hostage family to keep get the word out , not just because they want more people to understand what have happen and to imagine what it would be like if one of their love one be capture by Hamas , but because Gilad Shalit have be hearten during his captivity by hear on the radio that his family and the Israel government have not give up on he . his captor have allow he to listen to the radio from time to time , which be why the message of relative of the hostage be rebroadcast several time a day , and the message always include all the hostage , assure they that the effort for their release be ongoing without let - up . meanwhile , news of the release of the video , which be the first sign of life that Hersh Goldberg Polin & rsquo ; s family have receive since October 7 , prompt a spontaneous demonstration near the prime minister & rsquo ; s residence in Jerusalem with a demand to resume negotiation for the return of the hostage . the number of demonstrator quickly swell into the hundred , necessitate police intervention . Police push the crowd back into France Square , where the noise level be much loud than at demonstration last year . tribute to the dayan family ■ the FINAL rest place of member of the famed dayan family , whose contribution to the nation have be military , political , literary , and dramatic , include Assi Dayan , the celebrate actor and filmmaker , who die on May 1 , 2014 , and his cousin Yehonatan Geffen , the author , poet , songwriter , journalist , satirist , and playwright who die on April 19 , 2023 . because Nahalal be home to so many well - know personality , the cemetery , like the Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv , be embed in the nature of a tourist site , where the name on the tombstone be link to the evolve history of the state . write in Maariv , the sister publication of the Jerusalem Post , journalist Lior Dayan , in pay tribute to his father Assi , who unfortunately be a drug addict , observe that so often , when a parent die , his or her child say they regret that there be so many thing they never get around to tell they . but that be not the case with he and his father , Lior write . they tell each other everything , candidly and without secret . at the start of the lengthy article , he mention how the tour guide & rsquo ; s anecdote about the dayan family captivate the tourist group that visit the cemetery . on a recent visit to his father & rsquo ; s grave , he overhear a boy , stand with his mother , ask in relation to Assi , & ldquo ; so , what do he do ? & rdquo ; & ldquo ; he do a lot , & rdquo ; she reply . & ldquo ; a lot of good or a lot of bad ? & rdquo ; he persist . & ldquo ; a lot of good for the public ; a lot of bad for himself , & rdquo ; she answer . in Lior & rsquo ; s opinion , this be the most succinct and definitive summing up of who his father be .

Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim be the love of his life , and he be happy to stay there and devote all his energy to its development . but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former foreign minister Eli Cohen have other plan for he , and persuade he to enter the diplomatic corp . as a loyal Likudnik , Kashriel could refuse for only so long . but there & rsquo ; s one major obstacle by way of geography . Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim be locate in the West Bank . that hasn & rsquo ; t deter some leftist from live there , but it be a red rag to Italy , which decline to accept a West Bank & ldquo ; settler & rdquo ; as an ambassador in Rome . even though he be not due to take up the appointment till well into the summer , at this stage of the game Kashriel can not go back to be mayor , even though there be plenty of resident of Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim who would like to see he in that position . Hungary be mention as a possible alternative , but the next ambassador to Hungary have be approve both by Jerusalem and Budapest . the ideal situation would be for Israel to establish diplomatic relation with another country , and to accord Kashriel the honor of be Israel & rsquo ; s first ambassador there . but give Israel & rsquo ; s loss of popularity over event in Gaza , it & rsquo ; s unlikely for a new diplomatic relationship to materialize in the foreseeable future . quickly forget & nbsp ; ■ one of the sad thing about public figure be that once they resign or retire , they be quickly forget . a case in point be Moshe Mizrahi , who in the course of a long career serve as director - general of both the office of the president and the prime minister , and meet score of local and foreign dignitary while safeguard the interest of five prime minister and two president . Mizrahi & rsquo ; s successor begin to capture the interest of the medium , and Mizrahi be all but forget , except by veteran journalist and by lead figure of his generation . like many people who have lead exciting and meaningful life , and who have make significant contribution to the history of their respective nation , Mizrahi decide to write a memoir , which he launch at the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation , where speaker include retire Supreme Court justice Elyakim Rubinstein , MK Avigdor Liberman , who have know Mizrahi for some 30 year , Matan Vilna & rsquo ; I , a former deputy chief of staff of the IDF , politician , and diplomat , and Efrat Duvdevani , the director - general of the Peres Center . all four speak of Mizrahi & rsquo ; s strong sense of patriotism , his dedication , and his important contribution to the nation and its security .

Leibowitz have urge israeli soldier to refuse order that would in any way be harmful to peaceful Palestinians . Yitzhak Rabin , who be then prime minister , declare that he would not attend the ceremony if Leibowitz be to receive the prize . unwilling to fan the flame of controversy on the most important national day of the year , Leibowitz decline to accept the prize . the year 2021 be an uncomfortable one for Yoav Gallant , who be then education minister , with two Israel Prize scandal on his hand . one of the people select for the prize be Yehuda Meshi - Zahav , a haredi and former anti - zionist activist who found ZAKA and change his attitude to the extent of send his son to the army . but after it be announce that Gallant have inform he of his selection for the Israel Prize , story begin to surface about year of sexual abuse that Meshi - Zahav have inflict on both religious and secular woman . as police begin their investigation , Meshi - Zahav decide to forgo the prize and also resign from ZAKA . he subsequently try to commit suicide , but be rescue by one of his son . however , he remain in a coma for more than a year before he die . in 2021 , Prof .

David Harel , who be among the Israel Prize winner in 2004 , offer to share his prize with Goldreich . Yifat Shasha - Biton , who have succeed Gallant as education minister , agree with his decision on Goldreich . but a month later , Avichai Mandelblit , who be then the attorney - general , tell the High Court that in his opinion the prize should be award to Goldreich . in March 2022 , the court rule that the prize should be award to Goldreich , who eventually receive the prize in a private ceremony at the Education Ministry , and announce that he would donate the prize money of NIS 75 , 000 to five human right organization , include break the silence . Netanyahu would earn brownie point if he make a public statement to the effect that the Israel Prize be award on merit in a certain field , and that it should in no way be influence by political consideration . he should add that even though he and Waldman be at complete odd politically , he recognize Waldman & rsquo ; s contribution to technology , and will be pleased to congratulate he on that issue at the Israel Prize ceremony . israeli professor award world & rsquo ; s most prestigious prize for brain research ■ as PRIZES go , the medium be , of course , focus on the Israel Prize , and in pay so much attention , some medium outlet may overlook the fact that an Israeli have be award the world & rsquo ; s most prestigious prize for brain research . prof .

"two separate incident that take place in the West Bank over the past few day underline the discrepancy between the Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s rhetoric in public and its action on the ground . & ldquo ; the Palestinian Authority be a real Jekyll and Hyde , & rdquo ; a Ramallah - base western diplomat remark this week with reference to the inconsistency . & ldquo ; the Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s rhetoric towards Israel be bad , but its action on the ground , especially the security coordination with the israeli security authority , be good . & rdquo ; the diplomat & rsquo ; s remark be share by many Palestinians who be familiar with the inner working of the PA . in the first incident , two israeli woman in their 40 be spot by Palestinians late at night drive their car alone inside al - Ama & rsquo ; ri refugee camp at the entrance to Ramallah and its twin city , El - Bireh . the camp be consider a stronghold of palestinian militant belong to various group , include those oppose to PA President Mahmoud Abbas and his rule Fatah faction . the PA security force be often reluctant to enter al - Ama & rsquo ; ri to avoid friction with the group . in this case , however , as soon as the PA security force be inform about the presence of the israeli woman in the camp , they rush to the scene and safely escort they out and hand they over to the IDF . the second incident take place in the PA - control part of Hebron , a city traditionally know as a stronghold of islamist group , particularly Hamas and Hizb ut - Tahrir ( Party of Liberation ) . a bus carry IDF soldier that accidentally enter Hebron be safely escort by PA security force out of the city . no one be hurt and minimal damage be cause to the bus as a result of rock - throwing by a small number of Palestinians . the two incident could have end in a tragic way , be it not for the intervention of the PA security force . have any of the woman or soldier be harm , this would have result in a serious deterioration in the security situation on the ground and renew tension between the new israeli government head by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the PA . such an escalation would also have deal a severe blow to the Biden administration & rsquo ; s effort to rebuild confidence between Israel and the Palestinians with the hope of revive the stall peace process . the Biden administration have endorse a policy that seek to bolster the standing of the PA as a way of counter the rise popularity of Hamas . the Americans want the israeli government to follow suit by engage with PA official and refrain from unilateral move , include the eviction of arab family from their home in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah . indeed , Bennett & rsquo ; s government and the PA leadership appear to be move toward some form of rapprochement . in addition to the continue security coordination , israeli and PA minister recently meet for the first time in several year . moreover , the government have agree to increase the number of permit for Palestinians who wish to work in Israel , and , accord to palestinian source , senior PA official whose vip card be confiscate by the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu have get they back . some Palestinians maintain that the security coordination between the PA security force and the IDF never stop , not even when Abbas and other palestinian institution claim that they have suspend all tie with Israel , include in the security field . the incident in Ramallah and Hebron be not the first of their kind . several case involve israeli ( jewish ) citizen who be see by the Palestinians inside Area A of the West Bank have be return safely to Israel , thank to the effort of the PA security force . entry into this area , which be control exclusively by the PA , be forbid to all israeli citizen . Israel , however , do not stop Arab - Israelis from enter Area A . Most of the case involve Israelis catch in Area A be not publicize , probably in order to avoid embarrass the PA . each time Palestinians learn that the PA security force & ldquo ; rescue & rdquo ; israeli citizen catch in Area A , they accuse the palestinian leadership of & ldquo ; collaboration & rdquo ; and serve as & ldquo ; subcontractor & rdquo ; for the israeli security establishment . but the security coordination be not a one - way relationship benefit Israel alone . Abbas be quote a few year ago as tell a group of Israelis who visit he at the Mukata presidential compound in Ramallah that security coordination [ with Israel ] be & ldquo ; sacred . & rdquo ; although Abbas do not elaborate , it & rsquo ; s obvious that the Palestinians , too , enjoy the fruit of this coordination . first , the PA and Israel have a common enemy in the West Bank & ndash ; Hamas . Abbas be well aware that without Israel & rsquo ; s security presence in the West Bank , Hamas and another Iranian - back proxy , palestinian Islamic Jihad , would pose a direct threat to the PA . second , the security coordination ensure the continue flow of fund to the PA from the Americans , Europeans and other international party . in a bid to far curry favor with the western donor , include the Biden administration , Abbas and senior PA official have recently indicate their readiness to return to the negotiating table with Israel under the auspex of the Quartet member & ndash ; US , European Union , United Nations , and Russia . PA official who be talk about their dissatisfaction with the Bennett government be actually send a message to the Biden administration that it need to get more involved in the israeli - palestinian conflict . yet while palestinian security officer be & ldquo ; rescue & rdquo ; Israelis who accidentally enter Area A , and as the security coordination appear to be continue in full force and effect , the rhetoric of the PA and Fatah toward Israel remain as toxic as ever . this be precisely why many Palestinians and Israelis be confused about the real intention of the PA leadership . on the one hand , the PA be tell Palestinians that it want to prosecute Israelis for & ldquo ; war crime & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; ethnic cleansing & rdquo ; before international forum , include the International Criminal Court . the PA be also tell Palestinians that there be no difference between the Bennett government and the Netanyahu government , especially regard the policy of settlement construction and the & ldquo ; Judaization & rdquo ; of Jerusalem . on the other hand , this be the same pa that be allow its minister and security official to hold meeting with their israeli counterpart . similarly , many in Israel still can not figure out whether the PA be an ally or an enemy . the PA & rsquo ; s deed and rhetoric suggest that it be both an ally and an enemy . it be an ally when it come to work with the IDF in maintain security and stability in the West Bank . it be an enemy when it come to the fiery rhetoric of PA official and media outlet . & ldquo ; the Palestinian Authority have always excel in send conflicting message to both the Palestinians and the Israelis , & rdquo ; remark a veteran palestinian journalist from Ramallah . & ldquo ; the Palestinians have long become used to the duplicity of the palestinian leadership . & rdquo ; the PA & rsquo ; s action on the ground may be good for Israel in the short term . these action place the PA on the side of the good guy in the war on terrorism . in the long run , however , the anti - israel rhetoric emerge from Ramallah be far radicalize Palestinians . the PA , in other word , be drive more Palestinians into the welcome arm of its own rival , Hamas and palestinian Islamic Jihad . the apparent rapprochement between the PA and the israeli government and the Biden administration & rsquo ; s policy of & ldquo ; strengthening & rdquo ; the PA be critical for the continued survival of Abbas and his cohort . but this approach come with a cost . the close Abbas move toward Israel and the US , the more he lose point with the palestinian street . the Bennett government and the Biden administration may help the 85 - year - old Abbas hold on to power , but there & rsquo ; s nothing the Israelis and Americans can do to help he regain the confidence of his people . Abbas & rsquo ; s decision to cancel the parliamentary election , which be suppose to take place on May 22 , and the recent unprecedented massive security crackdown on palestinian political activist , journalist and social medium user have severely undermine the credibility of the PA leadership . at this stage , it & rsquo ; s clear that the widespread discontent with the Ramallah - base leadership do not pose an imminent threat to the PA . the PA security force remain loyal to Abbas , and the number of people willing to take to the street to demand & ldquo ; regime change & rdquo ; be decline every week . if and when the peace talk with Israel resume , Abbas be sure to face a radical reaction from the Palestinians . under the current circumstance , the likelihood of market any agreement with Israel to the palestinian public be zero . this statistical nonstarter be the direct result of the PA & rsquo ; s decade - long demonization of Israel , which remain one of the major obstacle to move forward with any peace process .",why is pa rhetoric so anti-israel when there is good cooperation?

Elwyn & rsquo ; s goal , and one of the goal of the intervention center , be to provide people with tool to promote their independence and involvement in the community , and they work base on the belief that everyone deserve to be include in society . the child treat at these center go through a daily schedule that be very similar to what child their age experience in other framework , but in addition to their preschool day , they receive a wide variety of treatment , include occupational , speech , and physical therapy . from the outbreak of the war , it take around two week until Elwyn be able to overcome the chaos of the beginning and to get organize , say Strul . & ldquo ; my organization know how to quickly get on board and offer service in an emergency , in the war , as it do in the corona pandemic , & rdquo ; she explain . & ldquo ; we be one of the first organization to provide service & rdquo ; after the war & rsquo ; s outbreak , she say . Strul note how important her organization & rsquo ; s ability to work independently be , because it mean that Elwyn do not have to & ldquo ; wait for the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry or the Home Front Command , who first need to handle thing that be big than intervention center . & rdquo ; her work be very emotional , help parent handle impossible situation , as she cope with the war herself , Strul share . & ldquo ; an experience that touch I personally be the story of one of the mother from the North , & rdquo ; Strul share . the mother & ldquo ; be evacuate and have just receive a diagnosis that her child be autistic . before she come to we , she didn & rsquo ; t know what to do , & rdquo ; Strul say , explain that the mother be force to leave her home right after receive her child & rsquo ;

s team , say Strul . this proximity at work & ldquo ; bring up the conflict that exist in the country , & rdquo ; she say . it be hard to avoid sensitive topic , at a time when tension and emotion be so high . there be & ldquo ; parent whose child be in preschool with arab staff , & rdquo ; which bring up fear for some of they , describe Strul , add that & ldquo ; this also impact arab employee who encounter jewish parent who be uncomfortable with they . & rdquo ; Strul handle these feeling with open communication . & ldquo ; you have to give these feeling space , & rdquo ; she say . & ldquo ; if you pretend these feeling don & rsquo ; t exist , they will come out in the end . so , first of all , we decide that we be go to give they space and talk about they on a local level . & ldquo ; if we see that there be problem or conflict , feeling that sometimes aren & rsquo ; t apparent on the surface but be under the surface , we address they , & rdquo ; she say . in ADDITION to the emotional turmoil of help the family from their center , Elwyn & rsquo ;

"the french movie the Sixth Child , which open in israeli theater on Thursday , bring to mind the famous line from Jean Renoir & rsquo ; s the Rules of the Game : & ldquo ; the awful thing about life be this : everyone have their reason . & rdquo ; the Sixth child , direct by Leopold Legrand , be an intricately construct tragedy about two couple who choose to make an awful but understandable decision , and they all have their reason . what & rsquo ; s brilliant about it be that , as heartrende as this story be , there be no obvious villain & ndash ; other than a heartless economy and an unfeeling adoption bureaucracy & ndash ; and no easy answer . as I watch the movie , my loyalty keep shift among the character , and I wasn & rsquo ; t always sure where it be go & ndash ; one of the high compliment I can give any movie . what be the sixth child about ? the movie start out show the tough life of Franck ( Damien Bonnard , who can currently be see in Poor Things ) and Meriem ( Judith Chemla , who star in the israeli film the end of Love ) , a Roma couple struggle to make end meet as they raise five child in a trailer park , which they have choose because it be near good school . Franck be a scrap metal dealer , and when his partner pick a fight , he , too , get in trouble with the law . Julien ( Benjamin Lavernhe , who recently appear in Jeanne du Barry and who be also in the sense of Wonder ) , the lawyer Meriem hire to get he out of the jam , be understanding and make a payment plan . to thank he , Franck insist that Julien and his wife , Anna ( Sara Giraudeau , one of the star of the Bureau ) , who be also a lawyer , stop by for a beer . Anna isn & rsquo ; t interested at first but then be charm by their child , and it turn out that she can & rsquo ; t have any of her own . they have try IVF several time and it fail , and psychologist have give her damning report when they have try to adopt , essentially say she want a baby too badly . a little while later , when Franck come to Julien & rsquo ; s office unannounce , Julien think it be because he need more help with his case . but it & rsquo ; s not that : meriem be pregnant with what will be their sixth child . they be devout Catholics and an abortion be out of the question , but they be already pack like sardine into their trailer . Franck desperately need money for a new van to replace the one that be damage in an accident ; without it , he can & rsquo ; t support the family . so he propose an unholy deal : their baby in exchange for money to buy a new van . Julien quickly shut he down : this would be human trafficking and highly illegal . but when he tell Anna about the incident , she be desperate to go for it . they float the idea of a legal deal : an open adoption , where they would raise the child , but Franck and Meriem would still be the parent and would be in the child & rsquo ; s life . but Meriem can & rsquo ; t bear this idea . she would much prefer to give the baby to this couple and walk away . at this point , Julien be desperate to shut down the whole idea because he know that to pay the couple for their baby would be wrong , legally and morally . but Anna can & rsquo ; t let go of this dream of raise this baby , and Meriem and Franck have decide they will give the baby up for adoption in any case , since they be in such dire financial strait . Anna & rsquo ; s determination over this baby drive a wedge between she and her husband . meanwhile , Meriem be despondent about the idea of give up this baby but know she can not give another child a good life . the STORY play out like a greek tragedy , in which each character follow his own destiny , no matter how much sorrow it will bring . you wish for a happy ending for all of they , know it isn & rsquo ; t possible . at first I think that the two lawyer would be portray as vile , predatory rich people , but the movie go in a different direction . they be portray as deserve of compassion because of their infertility , and if the film be anyone & rsquo ; s story , it & rsquo ; s Anna & rsquo ; s . while it & rsquo ; s clear that capitalism and anti - roma racism have put Franck and meriem into an impossible situation , they have a warm , love family , which Anna and Julien don & rsquo ; t have . there be no explanation give for the fact that they can & rsquo ; t have child , but it be devastating for Anna and , to a less extent , for Julien . the four actor work well together , and all give good performance , but the standout be Giraudeau as Anna . it be she who drive the action and can & rsquo ; t give up , willing to sacrifice her upper - class life to become a mother . there have be many movie about parent who fight over child , such as several film base on the Baby M and similar case , and many fall into clich & eacute ; s . the Sixth child avoid these pitfall , although toward the end , some of the resolution feel too neat . but it & rsquo ; s still a movie where you identify with everyone . you keep turn over their option in your mind , and will likely think about the character and the story long after the movie end .","'the sixth child': a tragic french story of parenthood, poverty - review"

"for most Israelis , Amir Khoury , a Christian Arab , be a hero . Khoury be the policeman who give chase early this month and help stop & ndash ; at the cost of his life & ndash ; the terrorist in Bnei Brak before he could kill more than the four innocent civilian he have already slay in cold blood . the Bnei Brak Municipality announce on Sunday that a street in the haredi city would be name after Khoury . Khoury & rsquo ; s father , Jeries , who also serve in the police , react to the gesture by say , & ldquo ; we be see unity [ between Arabs and Jews ] that we have not see for year . & rdquo ; for Ayman Odeh , head of the Joint List , Khoury be a humiliation . why ? because he serve in Israel & rsquo ; s security force . in a Ramadan greet Odeh upload to Facebook from Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate , where he say he hope to one day see palestinian flag fly , Odeh & ndash ; know to complain that the israeli police do not do enough to stem crime in the arab sector & ndash ; say all those serve in Israel & rsquo ; s security force should & ldquo ; throw your gun in their face and tell they our place be not with you . & rdquo ; Odeh say he have meet with group of & ldquo ; young Palestinians with israeli citizenship & rdquo ; from & ldquo ; occupy Arab Jerusalem & rdquo ; who have say they be be harm and humiliate by the security force . & ldquo ; it be important for I to tell you from here , the Damascus Gate , that it be a humiliation for one of our son to join the security force , & rdquo ; he say . Odeh then call on a & ldquo ; small minority & rdquo ; of Arabs who have enlist & ndash ; he put the number at a few thousand & ndash ; to leave their job . he say they be & ldquo ; humiliate our people , humiliate our family , and humiliate everyone who come to pray in the bless Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; so khoury , for Odeh , be a disgrace . and the historic unity that Khoury & rsquo ; s father speak about be , for Odeh and his Joint List , a political liability . this be a party that thrive on create division and enmity between Jews and Arabs , not on foster any kind of integration and unity . at a time of gallop terrorism , of citizen be shoot and stab in city street by fanatic whose terrorist methodology be use not only to kill Jews in Israel , but thousand upon thousand of Muslims around the world , Odeh & rsquo ; s message be that those Arabs who be engage in a battle against this indiscriminate murder be & ldquo ; humiliating & rdquo ; their people . there be many message Odeh could have deliver on the occasion of Ramadan . he could have go for the traditional : & ldquo ; may the crescent - shape moon of Ramadan brighten your path toward enlightenment . & rdquo ; or for the more spiritual , & ldquo ; Ramadan be the month to seek forgiveness for our sin , may Allah accept our prayer and pardon our wrongdoing . & rdquo ; he could have opt to spend his two - and - a - half - minute video talk about how the deprivation of the body during Ramadan be a time to concentrate on better the soul and on become a well person . instead , what be the message of the leader of the large arab party in the Knesset ? that Arabs should not serve in the country & rsquo ; s security force & ndash ; security force that also protect they . Odeh , who like to fashion himself as an israeli palestinian Martin Luther King , have a message not of harmony but rather of division , of perpetual conflict & ndash ; anything but conciliation , anything but Arabs and Jews live side by side in this country , share the space equitably and shoulder part of the responsibility for keep that space safe . while Ra & rsquo ; be Party head Mansour Abbas , Odeh & rsquo ; s political rival , be try to improve the lot of the country & rsquo ; s arab minority by work with Israel and Israelis , Odeh continue to sow nothing but division and enmity . religious Zionist Party MK Itamar Ben - Gvir have be rightly accuse since the onset of this most recent wave of violence of & ldquo ; dance on the blood & rdquo ; of the victim , of go to the site of some of the attack and fire up the crowd , tap into the rage cause by the terrorism to win new follower . Odeh be do the same thing . the terrorism , and the IDF & rsquo ; s response to it , be Odeh & rsquo ; s cue to fan the flame . sadly , that seem to be his only political ticket : what Odeh want to do be make sure the israeli - arab conflict endure . he see an opportunity to ensure that the discourse between Arab and Jew in this land be not one of integration , one of work within the system to get more for Arab - Israelis , issue that his rival Mansour Abbas speak about ; rather , he want the emphasis to be on the Aqsa Mosque and palestinian nationalism . Odeh can & rsquo ; t compete with Abbas on the integration card , on improve the daily life of arab - Israelis , so he need to keep in the forefront the violence and the conflict and the & ldquo ; occupation . & rdquo ; the & ldquo ; historic unity & rdquo ; that Jeries Khoury talk about be not the stuff that Odeh can cash in on at the ballot box . Odeh & rsquo ; s political oxygen be only conflict and the & ldquo ; evil of Zionism . & rdquo ; this , he believe , be what resonate with his voter , and this be why he must forever put that at the forefront and look for reason & ndash ; such as the recent wave of terrorism and the IDF & rsquo ; s reaction & ndash ; to keep it there .",ayman odeh is toxic against israeli-arab unity - analysis

"the outcome of the Jenin operation be unknown because no one know how far the IDF be go to go , or how and when West Bank Palestinians and Israel & rsquo ; s enemy , as well as its ally , will react . some early datum point gather so far have compare it to Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 , however , and also to Operation Break the Wave , which start last March and hasn & rsquo ; t stop since . so far , the current operation be a far cry from Defensive Shield , when the IDF occupy large swath of the West Bank for extended period of time , with no particular end in mind , and explicitly keep open the possibility of a long - term stay & ndash ; if it be need to reduce terrorism . IDF 's month - long operation in the West BankAll in all , the IDF leave after about a month , although it do maintain cordon around specific village and continue to go in and out of they in a volume and frequency far above anything it have do over the past year . that time be characterize by significant fighting that occur simultaneously throughout the West Bank , with the IDF encircling and place under siege then - Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat . More than 100 Israelis be kill , include dozen in one bombing alone , before the operation kick into gear . dozen of soldier be kill during the operation , with more than 20 , 000 reservist call up . about 200 to 400 Palestinians be kill during the operation , with an additional 200 kill the month before . the number of wound on both side be high . so far , nothing on the israeli or palestinian side currently come close to these number . yet this operation be qualitatively different from the routine raid and arrest that the IDF , Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , and Border Police have be conduct under Operation Break the wave for more than a year . although a dozen airstrike do take place , airpower have not be use by the IDF in the West Bank & ndash ; unlike Gaza & ndash ; since 2006 . as well , a full brigade of soldier have be mobilize & ndash ; as oppose to a small number of platoon or battalion . in term of number , this be as many as thousand of soldier in one case and a couple hundred in the other . IDF 's operation signal a strategic shift with temporary gainsanother point of difference be that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi have be personally follow and manage the operation , minute to minute , instead of the middle management of lieutenant - colonel . the operation would not go on indefinitely , IDF Spokesman Brig . - Gen . Daniel Hagari say Monday , add that several day be an option . for context , most operation over the last year last under an hour , or a few hour at most . this operation could extend for week or more if need , Hagari say . in addition , IDF Home Front Command be now on high alert , both in the North and the South , concern that the operation could instigate rocket fire . with all this , it be not even close to what have be happen over the last year , and it be a clear attempt to alter the strategic picture , use a grand show of force . yet in term of the ultimate result , it will likely yield only very temporary tactical achievement for Israel & ndash ; something akin to mow the lawn , which then need to be mow again soon after . this be the situation because neither side be really ready for another Defensive Shield , with its high price in life . they also be not ready for a new diplomatic opening that could provide hope for the palestinian side and douse the popularity of the terrorist group . IDF 's operation face tactical limitation and generational resistance & nbsp ; as of press time , there be no israeli death as a result of the operation . this be not only due to talent and luck , but because the IDF be act very slowly and very strategically in its gun battle . that can not last if the IDF go head - to - head with all the terrorist group over an extended period of time . the IDF can confiscate hundred of bomb and gun , but new one can be make and buy within month . one group of terrorist can be kill or arrest , but another can easily replace they . top IDF official have repeatedly tell the Jerusalem Post that one of the main reason the IDF fail to clamp down on the terrorist wave this past year be that today & rsquo ; s palestinian teenager and adolescent do not even remember Defensive Shield . they be bear into a post - reality of it , and so they be not deter from fight the IDF . they have not meet the might of an extended IDF operation . this one , without much more force or diplomacy , will not change that very fundamental fact .",will idf's war on jenin stop wave of terror against israelis? - analysis

"Sheikh Bilal Abu Hassan , a mosque preacher from Jenin , be surprised last week to receive a letter from the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs inform he of the decision to fire he . Abu Hassan lose his job because of a khutbah ( sermon ) he recently deliver during Friday prayer at one of Jenin & rsquo ; s mosque and in which he heap praise on the palestinian faction , include Hamas , in the Gaza Strip . refer to the Israel - Hamas war last May , Abu Hassan applaud the & ldquo ; Joint Operations Room , & rdquo ; which consist of various palestinian faction that operate as a quasi - army against Israel . & ldquo ; our Joint Operations Room have unify the Palestinians , & rdquo ; he say from the minbar , a pulpit in a mosque where the imam ( leader of prayer ) stand to deliver sermon . & ldquo ; this be the true meaning of palestinian national unity . & rdquo ; the mosque preacher in the West Bank be appoint by the PA Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs . every week , the ministry issue a directive to the imam concern the Friday sermon . the directive include instruction about the topic the imam should address during the sermon . occasionally , the ministry also issue instruction regard the topic that the imam be prohibit from address . those who defy the instruction of the ministry be often punish by suspension or dismissal , as in the case of Abu Hassan . on Wednesday , as Palestinians be voice support for the six palestinian security prisoner who escape from Gilboa Prison and protest Israel & rsquo ; s punitive measure against the inmate in various prison , the PA Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs announce that the topic of Friday & rsquo ; s sermon ( September 10 ) will be : & ldquo ; High moral in Islam . & rdquo ; the implicit message to the preacher : ignore the fugitive who escape from israeli prison . the last thing the PA want be for preacher who be on its payroll to stand in a mosque and praise , in front of thousand of worshiper , member of palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) . ( five of the man who escape be member of the Iranian - back terrorist group ) . the jailbreak be see by many Palestinians as an embarrassment not only for Israel , but for the PA too . the escape come at a time when relation between Israel and the PA appear to be improve , especially after the recent meeting in Ramallah between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Benny Gantz . now , the PA and its senior official and spokesman be be force to publicly endorse the PIJ fugitive as & ldquo ; hero & rdquo ; and issue strong condemnation against Israel because of the ensue crackdown on hundred of PIJ inmate , who be be transfer to other prison . the PA be be force to toe the line and join the palestinian public & rsquo ; s campaign of solidarity with the fugitive and the other prisoner because it do not want to be see as sit on the fence or , bad , be in collusion with Israel . the PA have long be face severe criticism for its ongoing security coordination with Israel . moreover , it regularly come under attack for fail to secure the release of prisoner . this week , at the Jenin refugee camp , home of Zakaria Zubeidi , the only Fatah member among the fugitive , even prominent Fatah activist be critical of Abbas because of his allege rapprochement with the israeli government and the Biden administration . the activist accuse the PA leadership of & ldquo ; abandon & rdquo ; its supporter in the Jenin area , especially the armed man who be want by Israel . to ensure that the mosque preacher abide by the instruction , the PA security force regularly deploy informant to the mosque to listen to the sermon and report to their handler . as far as the PA be concern , criticism of senior palestinian official , especially during Friday prayer , be a crime that can even land the perpetrator in prison . the same apply to any preacher who dare to heap praise on Hamas or other group oppose to the policy of the PA leadership . the PA be not oppose to mass demonstration in the West Bank in solidarity with the palestinian prisoner . but the PA leader also know that an escalation could deteriorate into another all - out war with Israel , something that be likely to far undermine the PA & rsquo ; s credibility and standing and boost the popularity of Hamas and PIJ , as be the case after the last Israel - Hamas confrontation in May . there be two issue that be consider the most explosive and sensitive among the Palestinians : security prisoner and Al - Aqsa Mosque . if the Palestinians decide to launch another intifada , it will be over one or both of these issue . the dismissal of Abu Hassan and the continued crackdown on Hamas and PIJ member be yet another sign of mount tension between the PA and Hamas . the late tension begin immediately after the last war in the Gaza Strip , when thousand of Palestinians take to the street in the West Bank to celebrate Hamas & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; victory & rdquo ; over Israel . score of Palestinians have since be arrest or summon for interrogation for participate in the pro - Hamas demonstration or voice support for the islamist movement on social medium platform . the PA crackdown mark the end of a short - live honeymoon with Hamas that begin more than a year ago . the two party have be at loggerhead since 2006 , when Hamas win the palestinian parliamentary election . the crisis reach its peak in the summer of 2007 , when Hamas seize control of the entire Gaza Strip after topple the PA . since then , attempt by Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Qatar and Turkey to end the PA - Hamas rivalry have hit a snag . the administration of former US president Donald Trump , however , usher in a period of reconciliation between the rival palestinian party . a plan by the government of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apply israeli sovereignty to part of the West Bank also accelerate the reconciliation process . Trump & rsquo ; s plan for Mideast peace , & ldquo ; peace to Prosperity , & rdquo ; and Netanyahu & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; annexation & rdquo ; scheme , which be reject by both the PA and Hamas as a conspiracy to liquidate the palestinian issue and Palestinians & rsquo ; national right , prompt the palestinian leader in Ramallah and the Gaza Strip to resume attempt to end their dispute . in July 2020 , Jibril Rajoub , secretary - general of the PA & rsquo ; s rule Fatah faction , and Saleh Arouri , deputy chairman of the Hamas politburo , announce that they have reach an agreement & ldquo ; to speak in one voice and under one flag , the palestinian flag , to build a strategic vision to face the challenge . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; we be now talk about a joint struggle , a campaign on the ground , & rdquo ; Rajoub say , call Hamas a full partner . & ldquo ; we call on all palestinian faction to see cooperation between Hamas and Fatah as a historic opportunity for a joint fight to establish a palestinian state and oppose the israeli occupation . & rdquo ; two month later , Rajoub and Arouri hold another meeting in Istanbul , to promote the reconciliation between the two party . the meeting end with an agreement to hold election for the palestinian presidency and parliament , as well as the PLO & rsquo ; s legislative body , or parliament - in - exile , the Palestinian National Council . Fatah and Hamas leader who later meet in Cairo under the auspex of Egypt & rsquo ; s General Intelligence Service agree on the electoral voting procedure , pave the way for Abbas to issue a decree set date for the election . as part of the reconciliation process , Hamas form its own list of candidate for the parliamentary election , which be suppose to take place on May 22 . the list include 132 candidate from the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem . in late April , however , Abbas announce the postponement of the election on the pretext that Israel have not approve his request to hold the vote in east Jerusalem . & ldquo ; face this difficult situation , we decide to postpone the date of hold legislative election until the participation of Jerusalem be guarantee , & rdquo ; Abbas declare . in response , Hamas denounce the decision , dub it a & ldquo ; coup against the path of national partnership and consensus . & rdquo ; Hamas and other Palestinians be convince that Abbas decide to call off the vote because of his fear that Fatah , which be run on three separate slate , be head toward another defeat , similar to the one in the 2006 parliamentary election . & ldquo ; for they , it & rsquo ; s evident that Abbas use the controversy surround Jerusalem as an excuse to cancel the election , & rdquo ; say palestinian political analyst Amer Ashhab . & ldquo ; Abbas & rsquo ; s decision be also see by Hamas as the end of the reconciliation process with the Palestinian Authority . & rdquo ; but other analyst say the defeat of Trump in the US presidential election be another reason why Abbas decide to delay the election . & ldquo ; Abbas receive positive message from the administration of President Joe Biden , & rdquo ; say political analyst and columnist Mohammed Abu Diab . & ldquo ; have Trump won , Abbas would have proceed with his plan to achieve unity with Hamas . & rdquo ; eager to resume contact with the US , Abbas and other palestinian official in Ramallah welcome the departure of the Trump administration and signal their desire to resume their tie with Washington . the PA leadership have sever tie with the US after Trump & rsquo ; s 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . the departure of Netanyahu from the political scene and the formation of the new government be also receive with a sigh of relief in Ramallah . the restoration of relation between the PA and the US administration and the improve tie between Ramallah and the government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett see Abbas move far away from Hamas . the talk about national reconciliation between the PA and Hamas have be replace with statement by Abbas and other palestinian official concern the need to resume the israeli - palestinian peace process . these be good & nbsp ; time for the PA and Abbas , provide that this week & rsquo ; s mass demonstration in support of the palestinian inmate do not lead to another major confrontation with Israel . the Biden administration have revive the talk about a two - state solution as the only way to resolve the conflict and state its opposition to any step by either side that risk spark violence or undermine the prospect for return to the pursuit of two state . additionally , the Biden administration have be say it believe Palestinians and Israelis & ldquo ; deserve equal measure of security , freedom , opportunity and dignity . & rdquo ; this rhetoric , in addition to the resumption of US financial aid to the Palestinians , obviously contribute to Abbas & rsquo ; s decision to again turn his back on Hamas . the israeli government & rsquo ; s decision to resume high - level contact with the PA leadership be also see by some Palestinians as another reason behind Abbas steer clear of Hamas . Abbas know that he stand to gain more by align himself with the US and Israel than make peace with Hamas , some of whose leader have never miss an opportunity to denounce he as a & ldquo ; traitor & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; collaborator & rdquo ; with the enemy of the Palestinians . for Abbas , an alliance with the US and Israel be tantamount to an insurance policy for the survival of the PA . he also know that such an alliance do not come without a price , make he less popular among the Palestinians . on the other hand , Abbas be well aware that make peace with Hamas would only spell trouble . he be not in a rush to return to the Gaza Strip and pay salary to ten of thousand of Palestinians . he know that even if he return to the coastal enclave , he and his security force will never be able to disarm the various terrorist group or prevent they from launch rocket and incendiary balloon into Israel . Abbas also know that any deal he strike with Hamas will jeopardize his relation not only with Israel , but with the US and the European Union too . when palestinian businessman Munib al - Masri lately ask Abbas about his condition for incorporate Hamas into a palestinian unity government , the PA leader tell he that the group must first accept all international resolution pertain to the israeli - arab conflict . Abbas , in other word , demand that Hamas recognize Israel & rsquo ; s right to exist . Hamas be quick to reject the demand , accuse Abbas of act on behalf of the US and Israel to & ldquo ; blackmail & rdquo ; the group into abandon its ideology and principle . & ldquo ; Hamas be not serious about end the conflict with Fatah , & rdquo ; say a senior palestinian official . & ldquo ; Hamas want to continue rule the Gaza Strip with the hope of turn it into an islamic emirate . Hamas be serve the agenda of foreign power , include Iran and Qatar , who want to see the Palestinians divide forever . & rdquo ; in many way , it be safe to assume that Abbas be comfortable with the status quo , which absolve he of responsibility for what happen in the Gaza Strip . the security coordination between the PA security force and the IDF also serve as an insurance policy for the survival of the palestinian leadership in Ramallah . Abbas know that as long as Israel maintain a security presence in the West Bank , Hamas will never succeed in extend its control beyond the Gaza Strip . the current strategy of the PA be to strengthen its relation with the US administration with the hope that such a move would ensure the continue flow of financial aid to the Palestinians . and despite its public criticism of Israel , the PA leadership seem to be relatively satisfied with the new and less hostile approach of the israeli government . the close Abbas move toward the US and Israel , the far he move away from Hamas . this leave Hamas with one option : enhance its tie with Iran , Qatar and Turkey as a way of tighten its grip on the Gaza Strip . the split between the West Bank and Gaza Strip , long regard by many Palestinians as a fait accompli , be likely to continue even in the post - abbas era because most of the official surround he be not know as fan of reconciliation with Hamas .",no escape from the growing palestinian internecine tensions

Haredi man have enjoy a legal exemption from IDF service since Israel 's founding . however , the most recent law enable the exemption be rule unconstitutional in 2017 , and after many delay , officially expire on July 1 , 2023 . the government give itself an adjustment period to come up with a new plan , but that period end on March 31 , and the state be require by law to begin draft some 60 , 000 haredi man of military age into the IDF . implication of pass draft exemption & nbsp ; the long - await conscription plan could trigger a political crisis . on one hand , Gantz in his Saturday video statement repeat his position that he would not support a bill that will continue to grant sweeping exemption to haredi man , and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announce in March that he would not support a plan that do not have Gantz 's backing . on the other hand , the haredi party , who be key partner in Netanyahu 's coalition , have insist that haredi man continue to receive the option to study in yeshivot full time , and also have argue that the IDF do not enable haredim who do serve to maintain their lifestyle . the departure of either Gantz 's National Unity party or the two haredi party ( United Torah Judaism and Shas ) would likely lead to political instability and even the government 's collapse . add to this be the ongoing legal case against the government 's delay in draft haredi man , and against financial support for military - age student in yeshivot . the High Court on March 28 issue a temporary order to halt the financial support and acknowledge that the state be require by law to draft haredim . the hearing on June 2 , which will be hear in front of an expand nine - member bench , will debate whether or not to turn the temporary order into a permanent one .

I have speak out against injustice . I have condemn terror , & rdquo ; he write . he add that it be a mistake to view the conflict from the narrow lens of territory . & ldquo ; this conflict be not just a conflict over land , for both people have the right to call Israel and Palestine their home . it be not only a conflict over history & ndash ; personal and collective . it be a conflict over the very right of two nation to coexist , & rdquo ; he write . & ldquo ; perhaps today be not the time for big international initiative , but the time for step & ndash ; maybe small , sometimes maybe bold & ndash ; that protect that goal of two - state , & rdquo ; Mladenov write . he urge Israelis and Palestinians to seize common threat such as the COVID - 19 pandemic and opportunity such as those provide by the Abraham Accords to find a way to return to the negotiating table . see as a rise star at the UN and as a possible UN secretary - general , he have plan to leave for a UN post in Libya . but at the last moment he bow out for family and personal reason , and will be replace by veteran diplomat from Noway Tor Wennesland . he be so vocal and so omnipresent , speak at small NGO event and shake hand with head of state throughout the region , that it almost seem as though he have become a permanent fixture to the conflict . the small achievement on the israeli - palestinian track over the last six year have depend on a large cadre of diplomat , but Mladenov be credit as the behind - the - scene official who maximize those effort to keep the wheel of a two - state solution slowly churn . he be a vocal envoy of peace on behalf of both Palestinians and Israelis , who have leave the stage at a time when his calming influence would have be essential to maintain horizon of possibility for israeli - arab and israeli - palestinian peace .","nickolay mladenov: israelis, palestinians lose envoy of peace"

"on Wednesday , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leader of the haredi party fail to come up with a new compromise on the controversial issue of the haredi exemption from IDF service that would enjoy legal backing from Attorney - General Gali Baharav - Miara . the attempt at a new compromise be aim at convince the Supreme Court & ndash ; ahead of a midnight deadline & ndash ; to give the government a few more month to have the plan pass into law . the attorney - general be the government & rsquo ; s legal representative in the Supreme Court , and she request that the court give she until 2 : 00 p . m . on Thursday to file the government 's official response . accord to israeli medium outlet , a leak draft of the response reveal that Baharav - Miara intend to claim that the state be no long authorize to avoid recruit yeshiva student , and should begin the process of draft they from April 1 onwards . regard state funding to yeshivot , the A - G be expect to request that the funding cease but not immediately , so as to give the yeshivot time to adapt to the change . the government & rsquo ; s proposal have be view as too weak because the haredim have refuse to commit to specific quota number of draftee per year or to any financial or criminal sanction for those who do not comply . Baharav - Miara say that without some minimal number and sanction , it would be hopeless for she to try to defend the bill before the High Court of Justice . it be expect that the government would ask for an additional postponement , give the inability to reach a deal to keep the government intact , with some report suggest a request for an additional 10 day . it be unlikely that the High Court would give the government much of a postponement , if any , and in the past , the High Court have often only grant a short extension than whatever the government have request to keep up the pressure . the court could also just let the issue play out at the hearing schedule for Thursday and demand answer from the government throughout that hearing . in the most extreme case , the court could order an immediate universal draft until the government put in place an alternative .

Fuchs argue that the A - G & rsquo ; s office initially refuse to support the decision for what it describe as a & ldquo ; procedural & rdquo ; reason , namely that the decision do not include an opinion by the defense ministry . on March 24 , however , the A - G & rsquo ; s office again refuse on the same ground , say that the lack of a defense ministry opinion serve as a & ldquo ; legal impediment . & rdquo ; Fuchs argue in the letter that the A - G & rsquo ; s office contradict itself and have not make it clear in advance that the defense ministry opinion be legally obligatory . he add that the reason the defense ministry opinion be unattainable be because Defense Minister Yoav Gallant be not participate in the procedure . & ldquo ; the door to the vault of government approval have be lock by the Attorney General & rsquo ; s Office and there be no key since , from a technical standpoint , it be impossible to receive the professional underpinning from the defense ministry , & rdquo ; Fuchs write . & ldquo ; until this moment , the Attorney General & rsquo ; s Office have not point out any core problem or problem whatsoever in the government & rsquo ; s decision and have not raise a & lsquo ; black flag & rsquo ; over it , & rdquo ; Fuchs accuse . Gallant refute the claim that his ministry have not cooperate , say in a write statement soon after Fuchs & rsquo ; s letter be publish that the allegation be & ldquo ; biased and false . & rdquo ; accord to Gallant , & ldquo ; every request that be receive regard cooperation with the professional echelon in the defense ministry or a piece of datum regard the conscription law be approve and will continue to be approve . & rdquo ; however , the defense minister repeat a prior pledge that he would only support a bill that be support by & ldquo ; the entire & rdquo ; emergency government , which include Minister - without - Portolio Benny Gantz , head of the National Unity Party . opposition leader MK Yair Lapid say in response to Fuchs & rsquo ; s letter , & ldquo ; the government & rsquo ; s wonderful ability to evade any responsibility be impressive , and tonight , who be to blame that there be no conscription law ? the attorney general ? you get it wrong : the blame be on those who be attempt to whitewash draft - dodging and discriminate between group base on blood . & rdquo ; a source from United Torah Judaism express the party & rsquo ; s frustration with the prime minister . & ldquo ; he [ Netanyahu ] sign an agreement . we want to pass [ a new conscription bill ] before the government & rsquo ; s formation ; he delay . we agree [ to pass the bill ] before the budget [ pass on May 23 ] ; he delay . if he want a government , he must ensure that yeshiva student can study Torah , & rdquo ; the source tell the Jerusalem Post in a text message . Gantz also threaten early this week to leave the government if an unsatisfactory conscription bill pass into law . in term of viable alternative and compromise that the government could adopt , there be a spectrum of idea that other party have present , and there could also be variation on those proposal . the close way to a compromise would be some variation on Gantz & rsquo ; s proposal of all haredim have to do national service , with a more symbolic number serve in the IDF . this would not truly address all of the IDF service inequality that have anger the public for decade , but it would at least show the majority of the population that the haredim be ready to contribute to the national destiny in a physical and quantifiable way . ( Haredim claim they care for the spiritual sustenance of the nation ) . also , if more Israelis from other sector be be pull out of necessary job , the haredim step in with national service would cover some of that gap . advocate of the Gantz compromise say it would temper some economic impact and start a social transformation within the haredi community by connect and contribute more to the nation . in practice , IDF source have say they can not integrate all of the draft - eligible haredim and that it would probably take year to do so , if at all doable . they explain that there be too many social and educational issue to work through to take in haredim in anything other than gradual number . & nbsp ; above a certain volume , it be not even clear that the IDF want to spend the amount of resource necessary to integrate so many Haredim at once . the lack of an agreement about how to solve the crisis be part of what have continue to allow the consistent rejectionist haredi position to prevail over the last several month , not to mention for decade before October 7 . & nbsp ;","israeli gov't in crisis as netanyahu, haredi parties fail to reach idf draft deal"

"incoming prime minister Naftali Bennett will be swear in on Sunday in the shadow of last month & rsquo ; s Gaza war , domestic jewish - arab unrest and amid the threat of renew IDF - Hamas hostility , particularly over Jerusalem . & nbsp ; the sequence of event that be likely to unfold in the coming week , let alone the come month , would be a test under fire for any prime minister , but will present a unique challenge for this particular government because of its unorthodox composition . & nbsp ; the new coalition head by Bennett of the right - wing Yamina Party and incoming foreign minister Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid Party also include left - wing party and the Arab Islamist Ra & rsquo ; be Party . & nbsp ; it & rsquo ; s a coalition that have an unprecedented ideological range and many of the decision that it make be likely to involve principled compromise by one or more of its member . & nbsp ; the israeli - palestinian conflict be the most contentious and divisive arena for this coalition and issue relate to it be expect to be one of its weak link . & nbsp ; it & rsquo ; s precisely here , on the israeli - palestinian front , the new coalition will be test , both within its first week and its first month in these four way . & nbsp ; 1 . evyatar outpost evacuation & nbsp ; Defense Minister Benny Gantz , who will retain his role in the new coalition , be poise to evacuate the West Bank outpost on Monday , less than 24 hour after the government be swear in . the outpost be build last month in the aftermath of a palestinian terror attack at the West Bank Tapuah junction , in which Yehuda Guetta , 19 , be kill . it be erect on a spot that settler have first attempt to settle in 2013 in the aftermath of a Tapuah junction terror attack in which Evyatar Borovsky , 31 , be kill . & nbsp ; the reconstruction of the outpost name in Evyatar & rsquo ; s memory be largely ignore by the IDF . within a month & rsquo ; s time , close to 50 family have move onto the site . & nbsp ; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s plea to Gantz to allow the community to remain be ignore , so only direct intervention by Bennett can prevent its evacuation . & nbsp ; should Bennett intervene , he would likely anger the left - wing flank of his coalition , as well as some of its centrist member , such as Gantz , who head the blue and White Party . & nbsp ; such an evacuation , however , risk inflame the West Bank and set off a chain of violent event . past outpost evacuation be often follow by violent retaliatory attack by right - wing jewish extremist against Palestinians . this would come at a time when Hamas be already attempt to inflame the West Bank . & nbsp ; 2 . the Flag March & nbsp ; Police on Friday approve a parade route for a right - wing Flag March set for Tuesday , just one day after the anticipate West Bank outpost evacuation . & nbsp ; the annual event be typically associate with Jerusalem Day event that mark the celebration of the city & rsquo ; s unification in the aftermath of the six Day War , in which Israel capture the eastern part of the city from Jordan and subsequently annex it . & nbsp ; during Jerusalem Day last month , however , marcher be prohibit from follow their traditional route through the Old City & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate and the Muslim Quarter , and be instead expect to head through the Jaffa Gate . Hamas fire seven rocket at Jerusalem during the march , thereby officially bring it to a halt . this month , march organizer have seek to hold the march along its original route and in the end broker a compromise with the police by which they would dance with flag by the Damascus Gate that open into the Muslim Quarter . & nbsp ; the area in front of the gate have be one of the city flashpoint for israeli - palestinian violence . Police closure of the area briefly as a place of palestinian gathering in April during the muslim holiday of Ramadan be one of the initial spark that lead to May & rsquo ; s violent outbreak . & nbsp ; an israeli flag dance by the Damascus Gate , which for the right be an important symbol of sovereignty over the city , be similarly expect to ignite renew palestinian violence . & nbsp ; 3 . palestinian eviction in Jerusalem & nbsp ; there be four exist land issue in Jerusalem that could lead to the eviction of thousand of Palestinians from their home in three east Jerusalem neighborhood . & nbsp ; the one that capture both medium attention and that of Hamas last month be the fate of some 28 family in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood . the High Court of Justice have yet to decide whether to weigh in on the matter or to allow for the eviction to move forward . no date have be set for its decision . & nbsp ; but date do exist for additional case . the attorney - general be expect by the end of June to issue an opinion on a land case in Silwan & rsquo ; s Batan al - Hawa that could impact at least 700 Palestinians . & nbsp ; another land case regard al - Bustan in Silwan that could impact more than 1 , 000 Palestinians have be delay until August . some 13 family , however , could be in danger of lose their home , irrespective of that ruling , because they fall under the dictate of the Kaminitz Law , which block they from seek any additional legal recourse . & nbsp ; one such palestinian family be already give a notice last week that he have 21 day to destroy half his home , otherwise the municipality would move to knock down that portion of his abode . it & rsquo ; s a demotion that could equally spark violence and the pende eviction that neighborhood have be under intentional scrutiny . & nbsp ; lastly , the issue of pende eviction in the Walaja neighborhood of east Jerusalem be also due back in court on June 21 . & nbsp ; the Right have view each of the case as land issue . the one in al - Bustan and Walaja involve municipal plan for park . the case in Sheikh Jarrah and Batan al - Hawa involve property dispute between Palestinians and Jews . & nbsp ; but they be see within the large context of the israeli - palestinian conflict and place within the prism of the battle for sovereignty in Jerusalem , with the Left and the Palestinians believe that the eviction be an attempt by the city to seize control of palestinian neighborhood for jewish project and resident . & nbsp ; the neighborhood battle have spark tension and violence , with the European Union and the US weigh in on behalf of the Palestinians . Hamas have also threaten violence as a result , and the issue of Sheikh Jarrah , in particular , be one of the spark that lead to May & rsquo ; s violence . & nbsp ; 4 . Gaza & nbsp ; the IDF - Hamas 11 - day war end on May 21 , but it & rsquo ; s unclear if the calm be a lull in the war or the end of this round of violence . Hamas have already renew its threat of more rocket fire with regard to the Flag March and there exist a real chance it could make good on its threat . & nbsp ; Bennett and Lapid & rsquo ; s coalition could be in the position in its first week of decide whether and how to retaliate should that happen . it would mark the first time that Israel would have a coalition with divergent view on how to handle Hamas rocket . & nbsp ; when Netanyahu become prime minister in 2009 , Hamas have be in charge of Gaza for less than two year , having oust Fatah in a bloody coup in 2007 . the initial Gaza policy and the first Gaza war occur under former prime minister Ehud Olmert & rsquo ; s watch . & nbsp ; the bulk of the Gaza policy , however & ndash ; include the 2012 and 2014 war , as well as the border restriction on good & ndash ; have be set by Netanyahu . it be one of the area of consensus within his government . the disagreement that exist center around the question of whether Israel have be hash enough , rather than too lenient . & nbsp ; Bennett , who often criticize Netanyahu for not do enough on Gaza , particularly with respect to the tunnel threat , will now have to decide how harsh a response he would authorize . & nbsp ; even without violence , other question must immediately be answer , particularly with regard to what type of good can enter Gaza and what mechanism can be put in place to ensure that Hamas can not divert material for military use . & nbsp ; the term of the calm between the IDF and Hamas that be now in place have yet to be set . Egypt be mediate indirect talk . it be still attempt to finalize those detail while at the same time attempt to create a permanent ceasefire that could include the return of the remain of two IDF soldier and the release of two israeli citizen hold by Hamas . & nbsp ; all these issue must now be deal with by the Bennett government , with the possibility that the failure to find a satisfactory response could lead to renew violence . & nbsp ; Egypt have also choose this time to become more involved in Gaza , a move that could potentially lower the possibility of renew Hamas rocket fire , but which may lead to tension point with Israel .",bennett@@@s first four under-fire tests on the israeli-palestinian conflict

"fifty - five year after the 1967 war , the status of the West Bank ( aka Judea and Samaria ) and of its palestinian Arabs resident remain unclear , temporary and officially dispute . because the war & rsquo ; s outcome be unexpected , Israel & rsquo ; s government at the time do not have a ready framework for the future . in the good of jewish tradition , minister and pundit spend week , month and then year debate the issue , wait in vain for the Palestinians to respond substantively . & nbsp ; for more story release for the 55th anniversary of the six Day War , click here . in this vacuum , some israeli group create fact on the ground that evolve into settlement and city on ancient jewish biblical site , while the army establish position that , in some instance , become town . the result be chaotic , with no strategic or political coherence . unlike almost every other country , Israel do not have clear border and operate two parallel legal system & ndash ; one for pre - 1967 Israel , and another for the resident of the post - & rsquo ; 67 territory . another unplanned result be the gradual morphing of the land from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River into a single political entity , in which the palestinian and jewish population of approximately the same size be lock into wave of terrorism and response . for the Palestinians , the 55 - year status quo keep alive the illusion of move the clock back to 1947 , abet by massive international support for a unique and mythical & ldquo ; refugee & rdquo ; status . the image of a single state in which half or more of the population be palestinian , and where Jews ( Zionists ) eventually disappear like the Crusaders , be far more appealing than a & ldquo ; two - state solution , & rdquo ; which would acknowledge the legitimacy of jewish sovereignty , regardless of border . while many Israelis have become accustomed to the stalemate , for outsider & ndash ; include many Jews & ndash ; Israel be present by the NGO industry in cartoon - like portrait of colonial settler , apartheidist and serial killer of journalist , accompany by the slogan and myth of international law . when Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh be kill in Jenin , Israel be automatically accuse of & ldquo ; cold - blooded murder , & rdquo ; ignore the absence of evidence . in part , this demonization reflect hostility to jewish empowerment & ndash ; in other word , antisemitism & ndash ; regardless of border , and reinforce by NGO propaganda campaign . the post - 1967 image , however inaccurate and unfair , make this easy . in parallel , after more than five decade , ten of thousand of family live outside the 1949 & ldquo ; Green Line & rdquo ; face outbreak of chaos and uncertainty . dispute over land ownership lead to year of legal proceeding and unpredictable court decision . this absurd situation be unimaginable for people live a few kilometer away , on the other side , in & ldquo ; sovereign & rdquo ; Israel . none of these observation be new & ndash ; indeed , they should be obvious . not obvious at all be what can be do in 2022 to replace the status quo with a well and realistic framework , if one can be find . the search for alternative that avoid the drift and end the chaos be critical for the future of Israel and Zionism . the goal here be not to propose another imaginary peace plan & ndash ; there be plenty of these gather dust on physical and virtual diplomatic and academic shelf . rather , my objective be to contribute to a renew israeli debate on option and alternative to the status quo , base on where we be now , in June 2022 . the hope be that through a substantive discussion anchor in political realism , Israel can move beyond the trap of continue chaos lead to a single non - zionist state . diplomatic Dead Ends : 1967 - 2022before consider alternative , a brief summary of previous effort be worthwhile , at least to avoid some of the illusion and mistake . immediately after the 1967 war , euphoric Israelis , who fear the bad just a few day before , be suddenly able to enter Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Old City and visit the ancient biblical site that have be previously close to Jews . a return to the narrow armistice line ( draw in green on map ) that have prevail since 1949 be , and remain , unthinkable . unlike Egypt and Syria , there be no international border in the West Bank to serve as a basis for negotiation & ndash ; Jordan & rsquo ; s Arab Legion have occupy this territory for almost 20 year , include eastern Jerusalem , and allow fedayeen to launch murderous raid into Israel . go back to the previous situation be a non - starter & ndash ; the question be , and remain , what should replace it ? in addition to hold Jerusalem , official agree that the Jordan River would remain as Israel & rsquo ; s eastern border , with a buffer and access zone in the Jordan Valley . but from here , the view diverge . Foreign Minister Yigal Allon present a plan in which small area such as Gush Etzion ( from which Jews be expel in 1948 ) would be incorporate . but most of the West Bank would revert to Jordan , note that : & ldquo ; from a demographic standpoint , a jewish majority will be keep / maintain , which would allow Israel to exist as a democratic jewish state , base on the principle of the zionist vision . & rdquo ; in contrast , minister - without - portfolio Menachem Begin adamantly reject foreign sovereignty over any part of the Land of Israel , include Judea and Samaria & ndash ; the biblical term that be also use during the British Mandate . however , while agree with Allon on demography and Zionism , he reject annexation , even as prime minister a decade later . begin & rsquo ; s alternative be autonomy for the & ldquo ; arab population in the Land of Israel , & rdquo ; include control of education , finance , service and other sector & ndash ; everything except security and foreign policy . neither Allon & rsquo ; s nor Begin & rsquo ; s proposal go beyond the debating stage , primarily because the Palestinians be only interested in turn the clock back to 1947 & ndash ; in other word , the elimination of Israel . nothing cause they to abandon the & ldquo ; all - or - nothing & rdquo ; approach and consider pragmatic compromise , such as a & ldquo ; two - state solution & rdquo ; or a federation with Jordan . in the POLICY vacuum , the israeli presence in these area gradually and chaotically increase . periodically , another attempt at change would start & ndash ; for example , in 1987 , then - foreign minister Shimon Peres negotiate secretly with Jordan & rsquo ; s King Hussein in London & ndash ; but this be another dead end . the Oslo Accords , sign in 1993 and accompany by a White House extravaganza , mark the most sustained effort , include the creation of the Palestinian Authority , which govern more than 90 % of the palestinian population . to Israelis , Oslo be present as embody the & ldquo ; land for peace & rdquo ; formula , lead to a permanent status agreement and presumably two state within five year . the term & ldquo ; end of conflict & rdquo ; be use frequently , and the demographic threat to Zionism seem to be avert . but to Palestinians , PLO leader Yasser Arafat market Oslo as a short - term tactical measure , to be renounce once the benefit have be realize . the massive UNRWA & ldquo ; refugee & rdquo ; support system remain intact , and the incitement and terrorist attack continue and even increase in the form of mass terror direct , or at least approve of , by Arafat . Israelis recognize that on the other side , nothing have change . and Israel & rsquo ; s improve relation with the so - call & ldquo ; international community & rdquo ; evaporate quickly when the IDF move to counter Arafat & rsquo ; s war . the next effort to end the stalemate take place in 2005 , when prime minister Ariel Sharon unilaterally & ldquo ; disengage & rdquo ; from Gaza and from two small civilian location ( & ldquo ; settlement & rdquo ; ) in Samaria . two year later , the Hamas terrorist organization take control of Gaza , follow by the acquisition of thousand of rocket and missile , and the construction of massive terror tunnel . Sharon become incapacitated in 2006 , Israel fail to destroy the nascent Hamas war machine and discussion of further unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank come to a halt , particularly with the election of Benjamin Netanyahu in 2009 . but Netanyahu also understand the difficulty inherent in an infinite stalemate , lead he to support the initiative for unilateral annexation ( & ldquo ; extension of sovereignty & rdquo ; ) . detail be not reveal and no official map be make public , but the discourse focus on incorporate the major settlement and the strategic area of Area C ( include the Jordan Valley ) . however , the effort became mire in israeli electoral politic as well as strong international opposition , and in 2020 , it be officially halt in the context of the Abraham Accords . as this brief history demonstrate , after 55 year , the temporary status quo , with all of its weakness , continue . at the same time , the default option of a single political entity between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River , with roughly equal population and the implication for Zionism , also remain & ndash ; and as note , be the Palestinian & rsquo ; s favorite . these problem will not disappear , and as Israelis , we have the obligation of continue to look for well option . a Strategy of Political RealismWith this dismal history , it be not surprising that many Israelis have give up . the long drift and its implication be not include in the election platform of any of the main party , and that be precisely the problem . it play into those who be not exactly supporter of Zionism and see the evolution of a one - state framework as the good path to their objective . to move forward by learn from the failure , a new strategy be long overdue , anchor in political realism and concrete israeli interest , as distinct from hope , faith or ideology . realism require the careful analysis of the relative potential cost and benefit of different option , include continue the status quo , base on security ( military capability , defensible border ) ; Zionism and demography ( a viable jewish majority ) ; and the perception of Israel from the outside ( public diplomacy and image ) . on this basis , and unlike Oslo and the other experiment , I suggest start from the end point & ndash ; Israel & rsquo ; s urgent need to determine our border . once we examine , debate and then decide on the area we need to hold and where Israel & rsquo ; s and Zionism & rsquo ; s interest be well serve by exit , the path necessary to reach this outcome can be consider . beyond maintain the integrity of Jerusalem , particularly the Old City and its sacred site , the core pragmatic requirement be to maximize security and minimize control over and responsibility for the palestinian population . in Israel today , about 80 % identify as jewish as compare to 20 % Arabs . among the world & rsquo ; s other nation - state base on a dominant ethnic , religious or linguistic group ( as distinct from inherently multi - cultural country ) , a minority of 20 % be already consider quite high , particularly when that minority have recidivist claim . border that would reduce the jewish majority to 60 % , for example , would add significant strain to the zionist jewish Hebrew - speak core . in examine other basic element , there be already wide agreement on the need for full control of the strategic Jordan Valley and the main access corridor to defend it . similarly , the settlement bloc adjacent to the pre - 1967 Green Line and within the separation barrier be readily incorporate into Israel , without include a large palestinian population . there be also a few exception & ndash ; sizable settlement locate in non - contiguous area , such as Ariel and Beit El . but with population of 20 , 000 and 7 , 000 , respectively , abandon they be politically unrealistic . the remain issue concern the future of Area C & ndash ; which , under the Oslo accord , remain , at least in theory , under full israeli control . extend from Jerusalem east to the Jordan River , and north along the Jordan Valley , this land be important strategically , and have a small palestinian population . & nbsp ; however , in the absence of a coherent policy , the Palestinians and their european support team be busy create their own settlement & ndash ; precisely in order to disrupt israeli requirement . the Palestinian & ldquo ; village & rdquo ; that have be create in key location like Khan al - Ahmar and Masafer Yatta , include fictitious backstorie to persuade outsider of their authenticity , be attempt to foreclose the option of retain this territory . the more time that pass before decide which part of Area C should become part of Israel , the more difficult this process will become . the final dimension concern perception . for some Israelis and Diaspora Jews , the most painful aspect of the post - 1967 status quo be the image of the jewish state as an occupier , portray as brutally deny the Palestinians their own state . this be the basis for campus boycott , Divestment and Sanctions resolution and other denunciation of Zionism . the question be whether demonization would decrease significantly if the status quo be replace with declare border , particularly if these be recognize by the United States and at least some european country . would the Jews who have become hostile to and alienate from Israel because of the 55 - year & ldquo ; occupation & rdquo ; move to a more positive relationship with Israel ? on these question , the evidence be unclear . the image of palestinian weakness and victimization , in contrast to israeli power , will not change regardless of any move in the West Bank , and Israel will still be blame . however , there be reason to expect that among those not committed to the palestinian cause and anti - zionism , the demarcation of border would reduce the hostility . nevertheless , base on a realistic assessment , the potential change in perception of Israel base on the setting of clear border and an end to the temporary post - 1967 & ldquo ; occupation & rdquo ; should not be consider a decide factor . in summary , while the result be far from certain & ndash ; and change the status quo after 55 year will be difficult to accomplish , particularly in the face of intense ideological opposition & ndash ; the great danger to Israel and Zionism come from continued drift and chaos . & nbsp ; the long we allow the illusion of temporary arrangement to fester , the more difficult it will be to deal with the result . ■ the writer be emeritus professor of political science at Bar - Ilan University and president of NGO Monitor . his late book , Menachem Begin and the Israel - Egypt Peace Process : between Ideology and Political Realism , be publish by Indiana University Press .",1967 to 2022: ending 55 years of ‘temporary’ drift and chaos

"the last week have be an anatomy of a spiral brawl between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden . first , there be the & ldquo ; hot mic & rdquo ; moment last week in which Biden , in an incident that many thought be script , be hear tell politician that he want to have a & ldquo ; come to Jesus meeting & rdquo ; with Netanyahu . that be follow by Biden & rsquo ; s attack on Netanyahu on Sunday , when during an interview with MSNBC he say the israeli Prime Minister & ldquo ; be hurt Israel more than help Israel . . . it be contrary to what Israel stand for , and I think it & rsquo ; s a big mistake . & rdquo ; on Monday a US Intelligence Assessment report speculate that Netanyahu could be overthrow . in speak about that report before a Senate committee CIA Director William Burns say , & ldquo ; I worry that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s conduct in the war threaten to undermine support for Israel in the long term include in the US . & rdquo ; a senior israeli official respond by accuse the Biden admiration of attempt to overthrow Netanyahu & rsquo ; s government . on Thursday , in a prolong speech before the Senate , its Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) call for new election to replace Netanyahu charge that he be an obstacle to peace and argue that he and his & ldquo ; extremist government & rdquo ; can not remain in place once the war wind down . he even appear to hint at condition military aid , a sentiment once express only by politician on the left - wing flank of the Democratic Party , such as Senator Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) . it be a speech that vastly expand the narrative to one that extend beyond Netanyahu and Biden , to include the entire Democratic Party . that Schumer be the highest - rank jewish politician , a centrist within the party , and an avid Israel supporter , make the blow even harsh . israeli outcry fall flatisraeli politician be quick to decry US interference in the democracy of one of its close ally , a tried and true refrain use for such moment . it fall someone flat , however , in light of the impact Israel & rsquo ; s policy be have both on antisemitism in the US and the upcoming US presidential election . one could see Schumer & rsquo ; s speech within the context of US domestic politic , as a sign of how nervous the Democratic Party be about retain the White House in November and the impact the Gaza war could have on Biden & rsquo ; s reelection chance versus his adversary , former US president Donald Trump . one could even see it as the start of the democratic messaging , now that Trump and Biden this week have clinch enough support to become their party & rsquo ; s presumptive nominee . opponent of the Gaza war in America often refer to it as & ldquo ; Netanyahu & rsquo ; s war , & rdquo ; scapegoate he as the cause of the conflict rather than Hamas . Netanyahu , who be already at odd with Biden and the Democratic Party over his judicial policy before the war , have already be view as a person - non - grata in Washington . now it appear that instead of turn Israel into a pariah , they be turn he into one . once Netanyahu & rsquo ; s big problem be that he didn & rsquo ; t have a Washington invite , now it be that the Democrats be be blunt about want to overthrow he . Democrats will explain to their voter that they support Israel , not its government and that if need , they will not hesitate to show Israel some tough love . it & rsquo ; s a message that of course play well for Republicans who have historically embrace Netanyahu , know for his strong relationship with Trump . Senator Tom Cotton ( R - AR ) call Schumer & rsquo ; s comment & ldquo ; inappropriate & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; offensive . & rdquo ; Republicans who be expect to campaign on strong support for Israel , now have extra fodder for their argument . those who worry about the interplay between the Gaza war and the US election , now have see the opening act of what will likely be an increasingly contentious democratic - republican rift over Israel . the Gaza war and the ensue israeli - US diplomatic battle over it will likely make or break the political career of politician on both side of the ocean and both side of the aisle in Washington . but when the dust have settle and the election season be over , the overall israeli - american relationship will have take a hit . those tie be strong when Israel remain a bipartisan issue . this week & rsquo ; s drama be a warning shoot across the bow , of how a raucous and fateful election could create a Jerusalem - Washington crisis .",netanyahu a pariah in washington? that’s a crisis for israel - analysis

"the war in the Gaza Strip be continue for its third month and israeli military casualty be mount . in an interview with the Media Line 's Felice Friedson , the Israel Defense Forces international spokesman , Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus , discuss the short - and long - term goal of the war and say Israel be pay a heavy price , but its goal remain unshaken : Hamas must be topple , he say , and the hostage be hold in Gaza , who still include 17 woman and child , must be return . Israel have no other choice . Conricus say the israeli army have expose hundred of meter of tunnel , some of which be very sophisticated . many of the tunnel lead to home , and house after house be fill with weapon , explosive , and rocket launcher . one possible scenario for destroy the massive underground city be flood it with seawater , an option Conricus didn & rsquo ; t dismiss . & ldquo ; at the end of the day , & rdquo ; he tell the Media Line , & ldquo ; these tunnel will hopefully be the undoing of Hamas . & rdquo ; the Media Line : Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus be the international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces . thank you so much for take the time to be with I here at the Media Line . Lt . - Col . conricus : thank you for have I , Felice . tml : on the day that Israel declare war on Hamas , those speak on her behalf stress that the path to victory would be a slow one , deliberate and costly . now , some 68 day into the conflict , observer be amazed that rocket continue to fly into Israel , and that the Hamas fight remain pretty lethal . what "" unexpected "" have you encounter in the last two month ? Lt . - Col . conricus : so , we & rsquo ; ve be fight for 68 day , since the 7th of October , and as we say from the beginning , even before we start ground operation in Gaza in order to dismantle Hamas , we say that we understand and know that it be go to be a long and difficult fight , that unfortunately we be go to have to pay a price in blood in order to achieve our goal , and that it will not be easy , but that our resolve be very clear . and all of we , soldier in the IDF , and officer , commander , the High Command , all understand that we have to dismantle Hamas in order for israeli civilian to be able to go home . now , we have see Hamas continue to operate throughout the war , and we see that they still retain certain rocket firing and combat capability . unfortunately , yesterday we have a mass casualty event in Shejaiya [ in the northern Gaza Strip ] where 10 israeli soldier be kill from the Golani Brigade and our elite aerial rescue unit , our tactical Air Force unit [ 669 ] . so there be still pocket of resistance in northern Gaza , and the fight isn & rsquo ; t over there . there be still rocket launch and there be still tunnel , and there be still terrorist there . of course , greatly degraded , but still there . and in southern Gaza , specifically in Khan Yunis , the fighting be ongoing and it will take a lot of time and a lot of effort in order to dismantle Hamas , but we shouldn & rsquo ; t confuse time and patience with a lack of resolve . the resolve be very clear , and we be go to defeat Hamas . there be no other option . tml : Lt . - Col . Conricus , look at the bloodshed , the loss of life of your soldier , do you underestimate , do the IDF underestimate , the power of Hamas ? Lt . - Col . conricus : I think what we can say safely be that Hamas have prioritize their military capability over everything else , and we can see as our force advance and as we clear area , house , neighborhood , and part of city from Hamas terrorist after we defeat they and dismantle the enemy activity there , what we expose be hundred of mile of tunnel , hundred , almost a thousand , tunnel shaft . some of they be very high - tech and high - level and a high finish of infrastructure . and we find house after house full of weapon , ied , explosive , rocket launcher , and anything that Hamas could get their hand on . so what I think I can see be that I think it & rsquo ; s clear where Hamas priority have be . they definitely have not be develop Gaza , care for civilian , build civilian infrastructure , school and hospital and mosque and road and clinic . no . it have be in furnish themselves with tunnel and buying and smuggling weapon so that they can go on their continued jihad against Israel . that will now be bring to an end . Hamas will be dismantle , and as our force on the ground advance , we uncover what Hamas be leave behind . we & rsquo ; re document everything , and we & rsquo ; re also share it with the world so that everyone can see where international aid have go , where it be suppose to have go above ground , and where it evidently end up underground in the hand of Hamas . tml : this have be go on for year , the smuggling of weapon , but do you believe the international community actually believe that today ? you might be say that here , and on many other international program , yet public opinion doesn & rsquo ; t necessarily say that they agree with the reality on the ground . Lt . - Col . conricus : I think that the polling indicate not quite what you say because I see very solid support among [ the ] US population , lot of sympathy towards Israel , the israeli government even , and definitely Israelis . and there & rsquo ; s a distinction between those three . and I think , accord to the poll that I & rsquo ; ve see , an overwhelming US majority , and I & rsquo ; ve see poll of western country as well , an overwhelming US majority support Israel & rsquo ; s quest to dismantle Hamas base on what they & rsquo ; ve see , what Hamas do on October 7th . the atrocity , the murder , rape , the brutal execution , and the burning of corpse and all of those atrocity Hamas do that seem distant now . it & rsquo ; s be more than two month , but it & rsquo ; s still very fresh in israeli collective memory . People see that , and people understand what monster Israel be deal with , and therefore people all around the world support Israel in our quest to defend ourselves . and I understand that there be certain elite , and there be editor and there be politician and people for whom it doesn & rsquo ; t fit with their worldview and agenda that Israel should be allow to defend itself and to care for itself and for Israelis to live safely within their internationally recognize border without fear of be under persecution , rape and murder . but that & rsquo ; s fine . they & rsquo ; ll continue to harbor their negative view , and we & rsquo ; ll continue to build our country , defend ourselves , and defeat our enemy as we have be do since 1948 . tml : the United States be very strong in support the Israel Defense Forces & rsquo ; action in Gaza . there be a bit of a shift . you see President Biden put on some very strong pushback at this point and he & rsquo ; s say that [ Israel ] have to pull back . he & rsquo ; s tell everyone [ to ] wrap it up in some form . how be this go to impact what the IDF be go to do in the come week ? what & rsquo ; s the pressure point here ? Lt . - Col . conricus : I don & rsquo ; t see one , and on the ground in the IDF that be not the perception that we have . what I see in news event and what I see the president say be , I stand with Israel , and I support Israel , and Israel need to get rid of Hamas . those be clear word that I understand . I see a lot of journalist try to corner the president and get other statement out of he , but I see a president steadfast in his support for Israel , unflinche and unmoving , and I think that be tremendous . that be the leadership that be so extremely important in time of war . and I see various other important american official , include senior spokespeople like [ John ] Kirby take a very clear moral position on what need to be do , defeat Hamas , bring the hostage home , and do it in such a way that it minimize collateral damage and damage to civilian , which be what we be do . we do listen to what our ally and friend around the world be say . we do take into account the criticism that be voice , and we do try to adapt , where applicable , our tactic on the ground in order to accommodate that , and of course , we communicate what we be do on the battlefield to the world , so that the world can see how we be fight , and also , very importantly , what type of enemy we be fight . how the enemy use cynically the civilian at their so - to - say disposal that they have in Gaza because it & rsquo ; s really how Hamas look at civilian Palestinians . they think of they as something disposable that they can use , in order to get public opinion sway against Israel and for Hamas , and in some case , it work and some people be call for cease - fire , and some people be adopt Hamas & rsquo ; talk point . I think that & rsquo ; s very unfortunate , but at the end of the day , our resolve be very clear . we understand what need to be do , and we also understand that really , frankly , we don & rsquo ; t have a choice . if we do not defeat Hamas , our people , Israelis , can not go back to live safely in their home , and that be a result that be unacceptable . and therefore we will continue to fight until Hamas be defeat and our hostage return . tml : there be still a lot of hostage leave in Gaza . be you close to get any of they out ? there be those in the IDF that attempt to bring two back ; they bring two hostage body back , and unfortunately other be kill . [ former Chief of General Staff ] Gadi Eisenkot , his son be kill in that action . so what be it go to take ? be it go to be a constant race to see how you be go to get the hostage out , and yet you might lose more man in do so ? Lt . - Col . conricus : it be a tremendous challenge . a tactical challenge . it & rsquo ; s a very difficult mission to deal with , because of how cynically Hamas be use the hostage as bargaining chip and as human shield . we have say very clearly from the beginning and continuously that we be go to spare no effort in get our hostage back , even if it mean to conduct tactical operation which will put soldier at risk . it be our commitment and our duty to bring our hostage back . if it can be do through diplomatic mean , great . if it can not be do through diplomatic mean , then we will do it in any other way that be possible . at the end of the day , our moral and professional obligation be to bring our people back . tml : what be the number currently ? how many woman be be hold today in Gaza ? Lt . - Col . conricus : as far as I know , there be 135 Israelis still hold in Gaza , out of which 17 be woman and child . tml : do that include the hostage body that just come back ? be it down to 134 ? Lt . - Col . conricus : I know 135 . that be the late number I have base on the late information . tml : be it 16 in term of woman at this moment ? Lt . - Col . conricus : as far as I know , we be talk about 17 woman and child . I could be mistake by one . these be move figure after all , but in any case , the very important thing be that Hamas , they themselves violate the agreement that they push so hard in order to achieve in return for a temporary cease - fire or a pause in operation . they be suppose to return 10 live israeli civilian , woman or child , every day . they fail to do so . they violate the term of the agreement , and then they also start fire . and there be a lot of speculation as to why they do that . I & rsquo ; m not go to speculate about it , but a lot have be say about it . but at the end of the day , contrary to Hamas claim , there be at least 17 woman and child still hold in Hamas captivity , 68 day after the war start . tml : the Wall Street Journal just come out with a story that you be flood the tunnel . it & rsquo ; s definitely something that have be discuss . be there anything that you can share about this with the concern that it can hurt the fresh water that the Gazans will need ? Lt . - Col . conricus : yeah , you know Hamas have be dig tunnel for many year , and we have be develop different countermeasure and technique in order to deal with tunnel , both those tunnel that be dig into Israel what we call terror tunnel in order to infiltrate into Israel , and also underground infrastructure that they have inside Gaza which be really the backbone of their combat network . I can & rsquo ; t go into detail . I can say that we be look at different capability and different component . we want to turn the tunnel from an asset that Hamas have really to a liability and eventually to their grave , and that be our intention . we be take everything into consideration . the location of Israelis who may be hold captive in certain area , and other consideration ; one of they you mention . but at the end of the day , these tunnel will hopefully be the undoing of Hamas . tml : look ahead , be it too early to look ahead for an end game ? where will the palestinian people be leave ? how will the israeli border be secure ? there have to be a strategy that be be discuss at the moment . Lt . - Col . conricus : I & rsquo ; m sure there be . yes , and it & rsquo ; s an important part . the IDF be part of the discussion at the cabinet and government level . we voice our input when ask , when solicit . and at the end of the day , the IDF will implement the directive give by the government . I hope , as an israeli , that a good and long - term solution can be find , one that first and foremost ensure the security and the sense of security for israeli civilian that hopefully soon will be able to go back to their home , rebuild their community . despite the heavy loss that they & rsquo ; ve sustain , despite the damage to their beautiful community , they & rsquo ; ll have the power , they & rsquo ; ll find the power . and with the help of the state and other people who will be help , also the resource in order to rebuild those community , and hopefully make they grow beyond what they be before . that be really reliant first and foremost on security be available and stable for those civilian to feel safe in order to return there . and then I hope that the international community will see it fit to join in and help , for once fundamentally change the situation in Gaza . we will free Gaza of the terrorist organization that rule with an iron fist , a heavy hand , over Gaza for the last 17 year , and that will be an opportunity for positive , more advanced force in the region , for nation in the region to invest in what & rsquo ; s happen and hopefully bring about a positive and sustainable future for Gaza . I care mostly about israeli civilian and our security , but I also understand that if there & rsquo ; s prosperity and stability and education for human value and perhaps even democracy on the other side of the border , that & rsquo ; s probably a good thing for we as well . so I be hopeful that that will happen , and I & rsquo ; m hopeful that there will be international partner who will see it fit to rise to the challenge and do something good for a change when it come to Gaza . tml : what be the big obstacle that the IDF be face now as they & rsquo ; re try to wrap up this war , particularly in the north ? Lt . - Col . conricus : yeah , I don & rsquo ; t think we & rsquo ; re quite there yet . mentally , we be definitely not think about wrap up . we be knee - deep in fighting , and there still be a lot of heavy lifting to be do . Hamas still have combat capability in southern Gaza and still need to be eliminate . we still need to take out the leadership , their command and control , and to dismantle and take away their military and administrative and financial capability . so that & rsquo ; s still ahead of we . in the north , if you & rsquo ; re refer to Hizbullah , then there be also a very significant challenge . as I say before regard Gaza , I think it & rsquo ; s very clear that we can not ask our civilian to return to their home and to be at risk of relive the atrocity of October the 7th that happen along the Gaza border . and that the security situation need to change . the Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi say so very clearly when he speak with local leader . before we ask you to go back , before we tell you that it & rsquo ; s safe to go back , we will make sure that it & rsquo ; s safe and that the situation on the ground will not go back to what it be on October the 7th . obviously , the first choice that Israel [ can take ] , or the first option that we will entertain , be not the kinetic military violence one . but if we be leave with no other choice , if diplomacy fail , and other option will fail , then of course Israel will have to deal with the situation and will have to deal with the presence of this iranian proxy at our doorstep hundred of yard away from israeli community . that be unacceptable , and it will not be the reality after the war . let & rsquo ; s hope that people , nation , and institution that have an interest in the safety of Israelis and the integrity of the state of Lebanon will intervene soon enough , so as to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and destruction and the horror that a war between Israel and Hizbullah may entail . tml : Videos be circulate show Hamas take over humanitarian aid that & rsquo ; s designate for their own people . what can you add to that in term of what you & rsquo ; re go through in try to get people to the right place , suggest where it might be a safe zone , and also the obstacle there in term of get humanitarian aid to the population ? Lt . - Col . conricus : Hamas color be shine through , and it & rsquo ; s another example of how they have absolutely no regard for palestinian civilian . they be just use they as cannon fodder , as human shield , and as pawn in their political effort against Israel . that & rsquo ; s very cynical , but it & rsquo ; s very obvious for anybody who be honest enough and can see . yeah , so the true color of Hamas be show . it & rsquo ; s evident that they absolutely have no regard for civilian , or palestinian civilian . they continue to use they as their human shield and as expendable asset in their political game against Israel . we see they loot UNRWA warehouse . we see they take over humanitarian truck and convoy . we see they steal fuel . we see they steal food and medicine that be intend through the generous aid of the US and the help of Egypt and many other part of the international community they be intend for good humanitarian purpose . and many around the world hope that it will get to their civilian address . but at the end of the day , Hamas have one goal . their goal be jihad , holy war against Israel . they want to annihilate Israel . they want to do the October 7th massacre again and again and again , and for that aim they have no problem take humanitarian aid , with steal fuel , or with take food that be intend for palestinian child in hospital in Gaza and bring underground into their tunnel for their fighter to have instead of civilian . so it & rsquo ; s abundantly clear . we & rsquo ; ve be say all along that Hamas abuse the civilian population . our hope be that more and more people around the world will see reality and acknowledge the fact that Hamas be violate everything that be suppose to be holy , and any of the basic tenet of humanity . they be commit crime against humanity on a daily basis . and I hope , really hope , that [ the ] UN and other humanitarian organization will finally come around and speak the truth about what & rsquo ; s happen in Gaza and call Hamas out for what it be : a terrorist organization that brutally abuse the civilian population . and it be about high time that UNRWA and other organization call [ out ] Hamas for what it be and start help we save Palestinians from the horror of warfare and get they out of the battle zone , provide they with international humanitarian aid , and make sure that it doesn & rsquo ; t go into the wrong hand of Hamas . tml : the clock be tick , and the family of the hostage be deeply concerned that they may not see their love one . it & rsquo ; s a big difficulty for the Israel Defense Forces , especially now when you be push forward with possibly flood tunnel . what do you do ? how do you secure those hostage at this moment ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : as I say , it & rsquo ; s a very very sensitive topic , and an extremely complex and very challenging mission . because of the sensitivity , I can & rsquo ; t go into the exact detail of the tactic of it . what I can say be that it be a top priority of the IDF to get all of the hostage back . we spare no effort [ in ] intelligence , manpower , [ and ] resource in locate the hostage and try to bring they home . unfortunately , one effort that we conduct a few day ago end with we only be able to return the body of hostage , but we will continue to collect intelligence , devise plan , and where feasible , execute plan in order to get the people back . we be aware of the situation , and I think that one thing that should be say be that for 68 day these Israelis have be hold in inhumane condition and the Red Cross have not yet find the ability or the political will to actually go implement their mandate and visit these hostage . many of they [ be ] woman , child and civilian , but soldier have right as well under the Geneva Conventions . all of they be entitle to a visit by the Red Cross to make sure that they be receive medical help , that they be safe , and that their basic need be take care of . that be what & rsquo ; s suppose to happen . sadly , it have not yet happen , and it wouldn & rsquo ; t be a minute too soon once the Red Cross actually get access and implement its mandate . tml : Lt . - Col .

"on March 22 , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announce that Israel would be take control of 10 km . of land previously not under its authority in the West Bank & ndash ; the dispute territory the world call the & ldquo ; West Bank . & rdquo ; Smotrich announce , & ldquo ; while there be those in Israel and the world who seek to undermine our right over the the West Bank area and the country in general , we be promote settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country . & rdquo ; this announcement largely escape mainstream and even israeli medium but be highlight by arab medium outlet around the world . as the Washington Post report , & ldquo ; if Israel confiscate land around Jerusalem , all the way to the Dead Sea , there will be no future for a palestinian capital in east Jerusalem , & rdquo ; say Hamza Zubiedat , a land right activist for the Ramallah - base Ma & rsquo ; an Development Center . & ldquo ; this be where a palestinian capital be suppose to be locate , accord to the american and european talk . & rdquo ; while Zubiedat & rsquo ; s reaction wasn & rsquo ; t factually accurate , it speak to the palestinian objection to israeli expansion in the West Bank . the american government strongly object to israeli building in the West Bank . american long - hold policy be not to state an opinion on the legality of israeli settlement in the West Bank . former president Donald Trump change american policy , maintain that settlement weren & rsquo ; t inconsistent with international law . current US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reverse american policy and declare that israeli settlement be inconsistent with international law . Secretary Blinken recently say , & ldquo ; our administration maintain a firm opposition to settlement expansion , and in our judgment , this only weaken & ndash ; and doesn & rsquo ; t strengthen & ndash ; Israel & rsquo ; s security . & rdquo ; Settlement legitimacyThe israeli government maintain that settlement building be legal and encouraged . israeli prime minister from the Left , include David Ben - Gurion and Yitzhak Rabin , to the right , include Menachem Begin and Benjamin Netanyahu , consider the West Bank historic jewish land . it be as much part of the land of Israel as Tel Aviv and Netanya & ndash ; if not even more . the West Bank be consider the heartland of historic Israel . Israel & rsquo ; s long history on the land , its intrinsic connection to the region , and the absurdity of claim that Jews be prohibit to live somewhere simply because they & rsquo ; re Jews , lend legitimacy to israeli expansion of settlement . no excuse nor justification need to be give for israeli settlement , just as none be give in response to Arabs who claim Jews can & rsquo ; t live in Jaffa or Tel Aviv . the US government and the European Union ( EU ) see a large issue in rebuild settlement than international law . the Americans believe the only solution to the israeli - palestinian conflict be the two - state solution . this plan envision an israeli and a palestinian state living side by side , in peace . settlement be build on the land the global community envision be a palestinian state . in their estimation , jewish settlement forestall , and could eventually end the possibility of implement the two state solution . many accuse Israel of build settlement specifically to prevent the establishment of a palestinian state . in 1937 , the British Peel Commission offer a two - state solution , and the Arabs reject the idea . the Arabs do so again in 1947 with the United Nations Partition Plan . in subsequent year , the Palestinians reject countless offer of autonomy or statehood if they would end the conflict by sign a peace deal with Israel . never one to miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity , the Palestinians have reject every peace deal offer by Israel . they have have plenty of chance to establish an independent palestinian state , but their intransigence have prevent it . it seem the Palestinians aren & rsquo ; t interested in their own state alongside a jewish state , they prefer a palestinian state that take the place of the jewish state . palestinian inflexibility isn & rsquo ; t the only problem plague the two - state solution . not only do Palestinians refuse to negotiate peace with Israel , but they also utilize terrorism as a method of obtain their political objective . contrary to a narrative popularly push by western leader and medium , palestinian terrorism isn & rsquo ; t just conduct by the extremist in palestinian society . Terrorism have the support of palestinian leadership and the people . leader incentivize terrorism through program like & ldquo ; pay for slay & rdquo ; ; teacher encourage violence by use example of terrorism in their classroom ; and society as a whole send a clear message by name street , school , and municipal building after terrorist . Palestinians expect the world to cater to their demand , reverse 75 year of history , and create a palestinian state along the border the United Nations set in 1947 . they imagine they can refuse to negotiate for peace and move to terrorism and there win & rsquo ; t be any consequence to their position . their assumption be irrational and unrealistic . the Palestinians have have multiple opportunity to create an independent state for themselves and have pass up on each and every opportunity for peace . their rejectionism have consequence . it be time the world address Palestinians honestly . instead of talk about a two - state solution and a & ldquo ; revamp & rdquo ; Palestinian Authority , it & rsquo ; s time the world tell Palestinians they have give up the chance of a state . their adoration of death , violence , and terrorism have defeat their aspiration for an independent state . they must give up their insistence on a state & ldquo ; from the river to the sea , & rdquo ; and even in part of it , and work towards a peaceful negotiate settlement with Israel . further terrorism and intransigence will only make life bad for they , go forward . until the world be ready to have this honest conversation with the Palestinians , they will continue to hold onto their unrealistic demand and increase their terrorism . the writer be a certify interfaith hospice chaplain in Jerusalem and the mayor of Mitzpe Yeriho , Israel . she live with her husband and six child .",what are the implications of the israeli expansion in the west bank - opinion
"the term & ldquo ; pogrom & rdquo ; be unfortunately back in our lexicon . & nbsp ; last week , israeli President Reuven Rivlin describe attack by & ldquo ; a bloodthirsty arab mob & rdquo ; in the mixed jewish - arab city of Lod as a & ldquo ; pogrom . & rdquo ; a jewish vigilante in Lod tell the Washington Post that he be defend its jewish resident & ldquo ; from a pogrom . & rdquo ; on the other side , when a video capture jewish rioter beat what they take to be an arab man in Bat Yam , a pakistani writer tweet , & ldquo ; this be what a pogrom look like . & rdquo ; so what exactly be a pogrom ? and be Jews the inevitable , exclusive victim ? it & rsquo ; s be over a century since the russian word & ldquo ; pogrom & rdquo ; enter the english language , but the civil unrest in Israel be unfortunately bring the term back into current usage . the New York Times , use the yiddish plural & ldquo ; pogroman , & rdquo ; & nbsp ; first cite the term in 1882 to describe the wave of anti - jewish violence that follow the assassination of Czar Alexander II , and provide a helpful inline definition : & ldquo ; riot against the Jews . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; the slavic root of the term , derive from the evocative word & ldquo ; to thunder , & rdquo ; add tone but otherwise give little indication of its meaning . pogrom be one of many word , include & ldquo ; riot , & rdquo ; & ldquo ; upheaval & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; disorderly conduct , & rdquo ; use to describe the horrific attack that plague jewish village in the Russian Empire from 1881 to 1884 as transient russian worker ride the rail from shtetl to shtetl , stop at every station to beat , rape and occasionally murder . & nbsp ; in the wake of the violence , some 1 . 75 million eastern european Jews migrate to the United States , the number taper off only in the 1920 when restrictive immigration quota be impose . the term pogrom migrate with they , from russian to yiddish to English . in the late 19th century , many jewish activist believe that Alexander III , the new czar , have give his blessing to the pogrom by direct police to turn a blind eye to the violence . this view be famously capture in Sholom Aleichem & rsquo ; s writing and in the musical & ldquo ; Fiddler on the Roof , & rdquo ; base on his story , when the local police chief let Tevye in on the secret plan for an upcoming pogrom . & nbsp ; toward the end of the 20th century , archival research lead historian to dismiss that interpretation of the pogrom . & nbsp ; the 1881 - 1884 pogrom be not organize by the bureaucratically inept russian government , which view the uncontrollable violence as a threat to the stability of the regime as a whole . & nbsp ; by contrast , the far more brutal pogrom of the 20th century , include the notorious Kishinev pogrom of 1903 and the bloody pogrom that engulf Ukraine during the chaos that follow World War I , show much clear sign of coordination by authority at various level . the last czar , Nicholas II , tacitly encourage the violence by openly support the violent Black Hundreds organization and even underwrite the publication of the antisemitic work & ldquo ; the Protocols of the Elders of Zion . & rdquo ; the definition of the word pogrom thus have come to include three essential element : a violent mob , jewish victimhood and at least the appearance of some level of central planning or incitement , although the attack themselves seem more spontaneous . & nbsp ; although the word pogrom first emerge in the late 19th century , it be later apply anachronistically to incident in the distant past . social upheaval direct against Jews be virtually as old as jewish history itself , with the street violence of Alexandria , Egypt , in the year 38 c . e . consider the early example . & nbsp ; throughout the medieval period , a combination of religious fervor and bloodlust motivate ordinary citizen to rise up and attack Jews in hundred of crusade , blood libel and false charge of host desecration , often with the tacit or explicit approval of rule authority . & nbsp ; the term pogrom be rarely use to describe the event of the Holocaust , on quantitative and qualitative ground : the Nazis murder million in a hierarchical , organized and bureaucratic manner unlike the erratic and spontaneous attack by pogromist . nevertheless , certain specific incident from World War II might qualify , such as the notorious Petliura Days of Lviv or the massacre of the Jews of Jedwabne . Kristallnacht , the & ldquo ; night of broken glass & rdquo ; that presage the genocide , be often describe as a pogrom . the word may be borrow for other purpose & mdash ; the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary relate a few citation & mdash ; but they often sound wrong , like dark example of cultural appropriation . non - jewish population often suffer very similar attack & mdash ; Mennonites be horribly brutalize by anarchist band in Ukraine , for example , and their woe compound by deeply hold pacifist belief that prevent self - defense & mdash ; but pogrom be deeply rooted in jewish history and narrative , no less than & ldquo ; intifada & rdquo ; be root in the palestinian narrative . two of the classic element of the historical pogrom be sadly present in the street of some israeli city , namely mob violence and jewish victim . the appearance of central planning , however , be hard to identify , and the term doesn & rsquo ; t account for the fact that the government and law enforcement be predispose to defend Israel & rsquo ; s jewish citizen . historically , pogrom be synonymous with jewish powerlessness . be it possible to speak of a pogrom when the state authority responsible for maintain public order be jewish ? & nbsp ; as for the use of the term pogrom by the pro - palestinian side : be that a fair label , with its ironic connotation that the former victim of pogrom have become its perpetrator ? or a foul appropriation mean to erase jewish history and & ldquo ; flip the script & rdquo ; ? & nbsp ; the debate be similar to the one over how to describe urban unrest in this country : be they & ldquo ; race riot & rdquo ; ? & ldquo ; Rebellions & rdquo ; ? & ldquo ; Police riot & rdquo ; ? & ldquo ; Uprisings & rdquo ; ? & nbsp ; & nbsp ; perhaps none of this discussion be helpful from a practical standpoint . when neighbor rise up and physically assault each other , especially after decade of peaceful coexistence , perhaps it doesn & rsquo ; t really matter what term we use to describe the violence . but the language we use shape our response to a crisis & mdash ; word matter . from the standpoint of history , name the violence a pogrom , a riot or an intifada will have implication for how the State of Israel choose to contain the threat . the view and opinion express in this article be those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the view of JTA or its parent company , 70 face Media . var theUrl = document . url ; var theurlarray = theUrl . split ( "" / / "" ) ; var theurlpre = theurlarray [ 1 ] ; var theUrlpostArray = theUrlpre . split ( "" / "" ) ; var theurlpost = theUrlpostArray [ 0 ] ; ( function ( I , s , o , g , r , a , m ) { I [ @ @ @ googleanalyticsobject @ @ @ ] = r ; I [ r ] = I [ r ] | | function ( ) { ( I [ r ] . q = I [ r ] . q | | [ ] ) . push ( argument ) } , I [ r ] . l = 1 * new Date ( ) ; a = s . createelement ( o ) , m = s . getelementsbytagname ( o ) [ 0 ] ; a . async = 1 ; a . src = g ; m . parentnode . insertbefore ( a , m ) } ) ( window , document , @ @ @ script @ @ @ , @ @ @ / / www . google - analytic . com / analytic . js @ @ @ , @ @ @ ga @ @ @ ) ; ga ( @ @ @ create @ @ @ , @ @ @ UA - 2449829 - 1 @ @ @ , theurlpost , { @ @ @ name @ @ @ : @ @ @ uniquetrackername @ @ @ } ) ; ga ( @ @ @ uniquetrackername . send @ @ @ , @ @ @ pageview @ @ @ ) ;",are the jews being attacked in israel’s mixed cities victims of ‘pogroms’?

Sa & rsquo ; ar claim that when National Unity first join the government , he be suppose to have be appoint to the cabinet , but he agree that National Unity Minister - without - Portfolio Gadi Eisenkot , a former IDF chief of staff , take his spot . & ldquo ; but we should have already be in a different place , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar say . & ldquo ; we need to act at a fast pace , with more force . we need to increase the military pressure on Hamas , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar say . he also argue that the destruction of Hamas & rsquo ; s rule capability be not proceed as plan . & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s takeover of humanitarian aid mean for civilian strengthen it , and undermine the goal , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar say . threat to quit governmentsa & rsquo ; ar also repeat a statement from early this week , that if he be not give a seat in the war cabinet , his party will quit the government . even if it do , it will not call for an election , accord to a clarification by Sa & rsquo ; ar & rsquo ; s spokesperson . a number of other party leader hold their own press conference on Monday ahead of their party & rsquo ; weekly meeting . opposition leader and Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid criticize what he claim be the coalition & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; disgraceful & rdquo ; attempt to wiggle its way out of a decision to draft haredi ( ultra - Orthodox ) man into the IDF to fill rank of casualty and meet Israel & rsquo ; s heighten security need . & ldquo ; the fact that they again be make up trick and finagle and delay be not just an affront to our soldier , it endanger the State of Israel , & rdquo ; Lapid say . the Supreme Court on Sunday give the government a small extension to March 27 to deliver its response as to why it be not draft haredi man after the law that enable the exemption expire last June . & ldquo ; if they care about security , they need to tell the haredi party : & lsquo ; friend , there be no more game . you need to internalize that you be do get without give . whoever do not enlist will not receive even one wear - out agora [ a 100th of a shekel ] , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Lapid add . Yisrael Beytenu head Avigdor Liberman say it be no long possible to talk about quota for haredi man to enlist in the IDF every year , and that it be time for a law that every 18 - year - old will serve for three year , after which & ldquo ; they will do whatever they want , & rdquo ; Liberman say . talk between haredi party , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant , and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have be ongoing over the past few week to find a way to solve the current haredi draft crisis . the crisis begin after the government last month announce its plan to extend mandatory and reserve duty for current soldier , but without recruit soldier from a broad pool of candidate , such as haredim , to lessen the burden on those who already be serve . the crisis also coincide with a court case against the haredi exemption that be currently underway in the Supreme Court . the previous law that enable haredi exemption officially expire at the end of June 2023 , and the government decide that it would pass a new law by the end of March 2024 . however , with that date nearing , the government do not seem close to solve the issue , and it be likely to request other extension until the end of June . government funding for yeshiva student also stem from the law that expire , and thus if no solution be find on time , haredi man may no long be legally entitle to an exemption , and yeshivot may lose their funding . Israel Hayom report on Monday evening that one of the possible solution be to raise the age of exemption for haredi man from its current 26 to somewhere between 35 and 40 . this mean that haredi man who leave their yeshiva before that age would need to serve in the IDF . the idea be that this will allow whoever want to study full time to continue do so , but on the other hand , it will disincentivize haredim who be not interested in study from use their yeshiva student status as a cover to avoid IDF service . Haredi man who be yeshiva student can not legally work . some minister , such as Smotrich , think prior to October 7 that the age of exemption should be lower to as low as 21 to enable haredi man to join the workforce early without have to do IDF service first . the new idea to do the opposite and actually increase the age of exemption would be a significant conceptual shift .",sa'ar holds first party meeting after break off from gantz

"contrary to most report , Salim Joubran , who die on March 15 , be not the first israeli - Arab Supreme Court justice when he be appoint in 2003 . technically , that distinction go to Abdel Rahman Zuabi , who receive a temporary appointment as a Supreme Court justice in 1999 . however , Zuabi serve for only nine month . Joubran serve from 2003 to 2017 and finish with the rank of deputy chief justice , as well as be the first israeli - arab to chair the Central Elections Commission . in that sense , he be the father of the idea that a minimum of one seat should be an israeli - Arab . since then , his seat be fill by two other israeli - Arabs . first George Karra , for a short term ; and now by Khaled Kabub . in that regard , Joubran convince the Jews of Israel that the court & rsquo ; s identity must somewhat reflect the country & rsquo ; s multi - religious nature , and convince the Arabs of Israel that partnering with israeli society can be worth it and have real result . not everything be perfect . there be an incident in 2012 when Joubran come under attack by many in the political sphere when he stand for the singing of & ldquo ; Hatikvah & rdquo ; during a state ceremony , but he clearly do not sing the word . ultimately , Joubran weather the storm , with many mainstream political and judicial official point out that as long as he stand and convey respect , that neither he , nor israeli - arab soldier , could be expect to sing about jewish longing to return to their homeland . Orthodox former deputy chief justice Elyakim Rubinstein be one of those who publicly come to Joubran & rsquo ; s defense at the time , and he eulogize Joubran last week as one of his close friend in the court . Most of the time , though , Joubran manage to stay out of and above politic . he represent Israel around the world and serve as one of its bright light in embody israeli multicultural coexistence . whenever critic try to tear Israel down as discriminate against Arabs , the example of Joubran could be roll out as a stark contrast to that narrative . Joubran be involve in a myriad of historic decision . he be on the panel of three justice who reject the appeal of former president Moshe Katsav , send he to prison for seven year for rape and sexual abuse . likewise , he be on the bench of five justice who reject part of the appeal of former prime minister Ehud Olmert , send he to jail for two plus year on various charge of public corruption . ever the independent thinker , Joubran be the one dissent vote on the Olmert panel when four justice toss out the large conviction for Olmert having allegedly request that a middle man give NIS 500 , 000 to the former prime minister & rsquo ; s brother , Yossi Olmert . have they listen to Joubran , Olmert would have spend many more year in prison . regard equality issue , he be a consistent and unabashedly liberal voice whether for Jews or for Arabs . he write soar opinion about justice and fairness that even his conservative critic sometimes respect more than they respect quieter closet activist , who often rule liberally but try to frame themselves in technical non - activist term . in his final case & ndash ; a 2017 ruling on same - sex couple & rsquo ; surrogacy right & ndash ; Joubran say that he find it difficult to come to term with a situation in which single people and same - sex couple be block from fulfil their dream to become parent through surrogacy agreement . he say he could not see the justice of give preference to heterosexual parent over same - sex parent , though the court as a whole defer the issue for six month to give the Knesset time to resolve legislation on the issue which it be already consider . in addition , Joubran advocate religious freedom and pluralism for Jews , often bang head with the haredi rabbinic establishment . regard israeli - arab equality , he dissent in a major 2014 razor - thin 5 - 4 Supreme Court decision which keep a law in place that allow & ldquo ; acceptance committee & rdquo ; to vet and reject candidate use vague criterion for around 434 yishuvim ( village ) in the Negev and the Galilee . that law replace an early law previously strike down by the Supreme Court which explicitly permit discrimination against israeli - Arabs in those village . however , Joubran and three other dissent justice say that the new law would be use to achieve the same outcome and impact as the old law of discriminate against israeli - Arabs , and possibly sometimes against haredim or other minority group . this be even if , at face value , the new law do not explicitly discriminate . the new brand of moderate - formalist activist ally with a grow group of conservative to keep the law , but unapologetic liberal like Joubran could not stand a law which would likely cause inequality , even if there be technical reason to avoid or delay strike the law until it play out more in the real world . in 2016 , in the High Court & rsquo ; s 4 - 1 decision , Joubran get to vote in the majority against justice Noam Sohlberg , invalidate a 10 - year price freeze and cap on legal liability rule that be part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s natural gas policy . Joubran also vote 3 - 2 in the majority against Sohlberg and then - justice Esther Hayut to suspend the policy for a year while the government would adjust the price and liability issue . but in that same series of ruling , the Supreme Court affirm virtually all of the many other aspect of the policy by a 4 - 1 majority , with only Joubran dissent . this include empower Netanyahu to override and circumvent objection of the antitrust authority on the ground of national security . this be huge . the prime minister , act as his own economy minister , could override the antitrust authority on a question of economic use national security as a reason . Joubran have no problem switch back to be in the minority on that issue to check what he regard as executive power overreach . critic would say that Joubran harm the country & rsquo ; s economic development and impose his own world view in place of the representative of the voter , Netanyahu . but Joubran view the court as the last line of defense of those in society who be weak ; and if that mean protect the antitrust authority in a way that slow down economic development , he be at peace with that . unlike other liberal justice , he be willing to say it out loud . I meet Joubran a number of time at conference and Supreme Court ceremony , and I see he in action countless time on the bench . there be some on the bench who strike I as having be promote up through the rank but basically remain the same as they have always be , simply at a high rung within the judiciary . Joubran seem to hold himself differently and think in term of his place and the court & rsquo ; s place in history , and try to find the right side of history to be on without getting drag down into the technicality of the moment . once again , conservative would not like many of his ruling but would honor his honesty and the sense that he be a true believer and not just play the politic of his sector of society . I also find he to be kind and a gentleman , with a lightness in an old - fashioned way that be hard to capture in the social medium punchy age of 2024 . a graduate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Joubran practice private law from 1970 until 1982 before leave to accept an appointment to the Haifa Magistrate & rsquo ; s Court . in 1993 , he be appoint to the Haifa District Court , and be then promote to the Supreme Court in 2003 . at his retirement , he preach strong commitment to coexistence and to integration of Israel & rsquo ; s arab minority . in an age of unbridled partisanship and personal ambition , Joubran & rsquo ; s voice of be respectful , honest , and genuinely commit to the State of Israel , though his background could have give he every excuse to take an opposite path , will be miss .",meet former deputy chief justice salim joubran: the embodiment of coexistence

"National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir 's announcement on Monday regard his choice of Israel & rsquo ; s next police chief , Avshalom Peled , serve not just as a general announcement , but also as a warning to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could act to topple the government if Israel agree to concession in a hostage deal that Ben - Gvir oppose . Ben - Gvir 's announcement be not bring for approval to minister Benny Gantz 's National Unity party , which respond on Monday evening that it expect Netanyahu to respect a coalition agreement give it veto power over major appointment . the fact that Ben - Gvir make the announcement without take Gantz into account plant the excuse to leave the government if Gantz apply his veto . this connect directly to a threat from Ben - Gvir early on Monday , in a post on X , that if Netanyahu end Israel 's war against Hamas without an extensive attack on Hamas in Rafah , he will & ldquo ; cease to have a mandate to serve as prime minister . & rdquo ; in other word , the timing of the police chief appointment wasn & rsquo ; t a coincidence , but a reminder of Ben - Gvir & rsquo ; s leverage over Netanyahu . in order to dissolve the 120 - member Knesset and force an election , 61 mk must support its dissolution . the departure of Ben - Gvir & rsquo ; s six seat in itself be not enough to bring down the 72 seat govern coalition , but it will give Gantz the power to bring down the government in the near future by leave with his eight seat . Ben - Gvir be hover around the 10 - seat mark in most poll , and he thus stand to gain from an election . but in order not to receive blame for the rise of a possible centrist government , he need to be able to explain to his voter why he decide to leave . inaction on Rafah couple with an inability to move forward with his choice of commissioner would serve as an adequate reason . unilaterally announce Peled as his choice for police chief may be a relatively empty threat , as it first must receive the approval of Israel & rsquo ; s Advisory Committee on Senior Civil Service Appointments . this committee usually approve the candidate bring before it , but in Peled & rsquo ; s case , it may not . Peled engage in illegal quid - pro - quothe Police Investigations Department recommend in 2015 that he not be promote after a recording reveal that he engage in a seemingly illegal quid - pro - quo with a local authority leader . pele wasn & rsquo ; t indict after the recording be disqualify as evidence due to privacy - relate infraction . then - police chief Roni Alsheich ignore the recommendation and promote Peled , but the advisory committee may not . still , Ben - Gvir & rsquo ; s announcement and National Unity & rsquo ; s subsequent response that it expect Netanyahu to respect its veto power , if it choose to use it , up the pressure on the prime minister to appease Ben - Gvir by other mean to keep the national security minister on board . the move be typical of Ben - Gvir , who , on a number of occasion , have threaten to leave the government unless he receive certain concession . for example , Ben - Gvir threaten to jump ship when Netanyahu be about to announce a freeze on the judicial reform just over a year ago , follow mass protest and strike . Netanyahu convince he to stay despite the freeze by agree to a government decision to begin the process of form a National Guard , which be a major policy goal for Ben - Gvir . this time around , Ben - Gvir may condition remain in the government after a hostage deal on a commitment from Netanyahu to push through Peled & rsquo ; s appointment regardless of the National Unity veto . if Peled & rsquo ; s candidacy be strike down , Ben - Gvir will likely demand something else . for most of 2023 , Ben - Gvir be consider a loose cannon and the large potential threat to Netanyahu & rsquo ; s government . but with haredi party take over in recent month as the major political threat due to the issue of haredi national service , Ben - Gvir make his presence feel and remind the prime minister that he must be take into account as well . & nbsp ;",ben-gvir's police chief announcement is a veiled political threat - analysis

Ibrahim , the father of two of the boy kill in the missile attack , walk in silently , his head wrap loosely with a scarf . there be nothing to say , and the two man sit silently as one , and then another cousin come to sit on the rug , and Saed serve they coffee . the corrugate tin panel that use to make up the shig where the boy die lie flat in a pile next to a new shig which have be quickly build to replace it . & nbsp ; here , in this isolate place in the desert , their little village be one of some 35 unrecognized Bedouin village dot the Negev desert . despite numerous request to the government from the resident , they have no air raid siren , nor be they allow to build a safe room or communal bomb shelter , so the boy have no chance . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we have everything we need here , & rdquo ; Saed , who serve in the IDF , say . & ldquo ; we just need bomb shelter . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; so far , no temporary bomb shelter have be set up for the unrecognized village , although at the entrance of the village the Islamic Movement bring two large cement pipe and place cement slab on either side & ndash ; as if that would protect anyone . accord to Saed , the Dead Sea Works potash plant put together a & ldquo ; shelter & rdquo ; with huge industrialize - size bag of dirt but no roof cover . neither shelter afford protection worth the effort of try to reach it during a rocket attack . some 400 , 000 Bedouin live in Israel in an area range from Beersheba to Arad . this include 100 , 000 in the 35 unrecognized village , such as al - Bat , which have no electricity , run water , paved road , or school infrastructure ; and 300 , 000 in seven establish town . thus the Negev Bedouin represent the most vulnerable socioeconomic group in Israel . & nbsp ; accord to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , at one point there be 46 unrecognized Bedouin village . follow the state & rsquo ; s recognition of 11 of they , 35 village in the Negev still remain unrecognized , with some still in the same location since before the creation of the State of Israel , and other in their current location follow Israel & rsquo ; s transfer of the resident there during the period of military rule . & nbsp ; since the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 , at least 26 Bedouin citizen of Israel have be kill & ndash ; 19 by Hamas terrorist in the kibbutzim where they be work early on that Saturday morning , and seven by Hamas missile . Osama Abu Asa , a Bedouin guard at the Supernova concert , be kill as he attempt to protect some of the young people hide in a bomb shelter , believe that Hamas would not kill he because he be a Muslim .

I be shock by what be happen to they . they be in a terrible situation . but I will continue to go to speak with they . it be not easy for any of we . & rdquo ; President Isaac Herzog visit the Bedouin Situation Room in Rahat on October 26 , where jewish and arab Israelis be work together to provide care package for the most needy of the area & rsquo ; s resident , and meet with community leader and family of the missing and murder of the community , include representative of the Ziadna family . & ldquo ; we will continue to live together , and it be important for I to tell the entire arab society in Israel how much I appreciate the responsibility show across the community in these difficult day , & rdquo ; he tell they on October 26 . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we deeply share in their grief .

"Israel will forever be grateful to US President Joe Biden for the support that he show the batter country in the day immediately follow the October 7 massacre . Israel will forever be grateful for the way he stand by the country in its darkest hour , how he warn Iran and its proxy Hezbollah not to take advantage of the situation and fully open other front against Israel , and how he send US aircraft carrier strike force to the region to back up those warning . and , indeed , Iran and Hezbollah be deter . Israel will forever be grateful for the way Biden immediately launch an arm airlift to the country , make good on his promise to ensure that Israel have the wherewithal to defend itself . the country will also long remember the way he come here 11 day after Hamas & rsquo ; s attack , the first US president to visit Israel in time of war , and relieve the country & rsquo ; s stunning feeling of isolation by demonstrate genuine sympathy and empathy . many , frankly , be surprise by the democratic president & rsquo ; s unequivocal , unstinting support . in the day and week immediately follow October 7 , Biden do the right thing by Israel . Hamas welcome the resolution that the US allow to passOn Monday , by instruct the US not to veto Security Council Resolution 2728 call for an immediate ceasefire for Ramadan that will lead to a & ldquo ; last sustainable & rdquo ; ceasefire but not make that contingent on the Security Council & rsquo ; s call in the same resolution for Hamas & ndash ; which it have yet to condemn for October 7 & ndash ; to release all the hostage , he do the wrong thing by Israel . it do not take long for the consequence of this action to be feel . just hour after Hamas welcome the resolution ( imagine the UN Security Council pass a resolution that ISIS or al - Qaeda , Hamas & rsquo ; s twin , would welcome ) , the terrorist organization turn down the term painstakingly hammer out in week of negotiation for a ceasefire and hostage release deal . the refusal of the Security Council to even once & ndash ; either through a resolution or in a statement put out by its president & ndash ; condemn Hamas for its October 7 atrocity be staggering . especially consider that the council know how to condemn terrorism when Israel be not on the receiving end . for example , on March 22 , one day after a terrorist attack in Moscow kill some 140 people , the council issue a statement condemning & ldquo ; in the strong term the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack . & rdquo ; the council swiftly issue a similar statement on Wednesday , within 24 hour of when a suicide bomber in Pakistan kill five chinese worker and their pakistani driver . yet it & rsquo ; s now 174 day since terrorist murder 1 , 200 people in Israel , kidnap more than 240 hostage , rape woman , burn baby , mutilated body , set fire to entire community , and no similar statement from the Security Council have yet be issue . and some still wonder why Israelis be cynical of world opinion and not particularly move by Security Council action . it be clear why Hamas reject the hostage dealjust as it be clear why Hamas would welcome Monday & rsquo ; s Security Council resolution , it be also equally clear why it reject the hostage deal on the table . Hamas welcome the resolution despite its call for an immediate release of all the hostage , because it know that the world will focus on the first part of the first clause in the nonbinding resolution & ndash ; press Israel hard to stop the fighting & ndash ; and pay less attention to the second part of that same clause : a call for Hamas to release all the hostage . why will the world not press the second part of that clause ? because it know full well that Hamas operate way outside the bound of civil society and that the terrorist organization be not go to heed any such call . it be also clear follow the resolution that Hamas would stiffen its condition on a hostage deal , sense that if it just hold out long , international pressure will force Israel to stop the war , enable the terrorist group to survive to fight & ndash ; mean to murder , rape , and mutilate & ndash ; another day . Security Council Resolution 2728 undoubtedly strengthen Hamas & rsquo ; s feel that the international community would & ldquo ; deliver & rdquo ; Israel . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s office put out a statement say as much on Tuesday . & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s stance clearly demonstrate its utter disinterest in a negotiate deal and attest to the damage do by the UN Security Council & rsquo ; s resolution . & rdquo ; while there be a tendency among many pundit and most opposition politician to reject anything Netanyahu say and to reflexively place the blame on Netanyahu rather than Biden whenever the two be at odd , in this case , that reflex be misplace . put aside whether , as a result of the US failure to veto the resolution , it be wise for Netanyahu to cancel Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Council head Tzachi Hanegbi & rsquo ; s trip to Washington this week to consult on how to pursue the war in Rafah ( it wasn & rsquo ; t ) , and whether move such as these have political motivation ( they do ) . nevertheless , Netanyahu be not always to blame in these confrontation with America , nor be Biden always free of fault . do not assume that another pm would have well relation with the USOn Tuesday , one lead columnist write in Yediot Aharonot : & ldquo ; do we need anything more than what be happen in our relation with America to understand the abyss the prime minister be lead we into ? what else need to happen to understand that every additional day he sit in his chair , our international situation deteriorate , and the crisis with our big and only friend & ndash ; our arm supplier & ndash ; get bad ? & rdquo ; the columnist assume that be someone else sit in the prime minister & rsquo ; s chair right now , with the war in Gaza in its sixth month and picture of Palestinians suffer flood the traditional and social medium in the West , Israel & rsquo ; s situation in the world would be any well . but that be an erroneous assumption . have even Yesh Atid & rsquo ; s Yair Lapid be prime minister when October 7 happen , it be hard to believe that the country & rsquo ; s policy toward Hamas and the IDF & rsquo ; s way of prosecute the war would be that significantly different from what they be now . while perhaps there would be more of an emphasis on the & ldquo ; day after & rdquo ; and a more receptive ear to international plea for more humanitarian aid into Gaza , Israel would have the same war aim it have now of destroy Hamas & rsquo ; s capability . that aim & ndash ; unfortunately , because of the way Hamas have choose to fight & ndash ; will lead to a high number of palestinian civilian casualty and much palestinian suffering , regardless of who be sit in the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office . and it be those casualty and that suffer that , more than anything , be drive the wedge between Jerusalem and Washington . if you doubt this , look back to the day of the Naftali Bennett and Lapid tag - team government and think whether Israel & rsquo ; s position among the progressive Democrats in the US be that much well than it be under Netanyahu . it wasn & rsquo ; t , because the anti - israel progressive and & ldquo ; social justice activist & rdquo ; who be all impact Biden & rsquo ; s policy right now during an election year be oppose not only to Netanyahu but to Israel itself , regardless of who lead the country . in their mind , Israel be an instrument of white supremacy and imperialism , and regardless of the identity of the prime minister or composition of his government , the jewish state would still be an illegitimate , racist , colonialist enterprise in their eye . US official be quote as say that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s decision not to send Dermer and Hanegbi to Washington for consultation be motivate by political consideration . and they be probably right . be see as willing to stand up to US pressure play well politically with Netanyahu & rsquo ; s base . but there be something disingenuous in this criticism of Netanyahu for let political consideration influence his policy . be not political consideration now also heavily influence Biden & rsquo ; s policy in this crisis ? last month , the US veto a similar resolution at the Security Council call for an immediate ceasefire . why do it not do the same thing now ? what change in the interim ? several thing change . among they be that the casualty figure in Gaza continue to rise , and another be that Biden be getting pound by progressive Democrats and arab Americans for his support of Israel . Biden & rsquo ; s tone and the tone of his administration have change markedly in the last two month , and that have to do with arab Americans vote & ndash ; or not vote & ndash ; in Michigan and with progressive unenthuse by the Biden campaign , harshly critical of his Israel policy , and threaten either to vote for a third party candidate or stay at home on Election Day , November 5 . both Biden and Netanyahu be political animal , and both be use their disagreement for their own political purpose . but to say this be all Netanyahu & rsquo ; s fault , and that Israel & rsquo ; s position in the world and in Washington would be sterling even amid a war such as this if someone else be call the shot in Jerusalem , be unrealistic . this doesn & rsquo ; t mean that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s handle of the relationship with the US during the war have be flawless . it most definitely have not . for example , Netanyahu could have play Monday & rsquo ; s Security Council resolution completely differently & ndash ; accept a two - week ceasefire for the duration of Ramadan to win favor with the Biden administration and the world , and then resume fighting at the end of the muslim holy month if Hamas do not release the hostage . at that point , Israel could say that it fulfil the resolution , but Hamas do not & ndash ; place the onus on the terrorist organization . Netanyahu could have do thing differently , but not all the tension in the relationship can be dump on his doorstep . Netanyahu & ndash ; with all his fault & ndash ; be not always wrong , nor be Biden & ndash ; with all the support he have give Israel since October 7 & ndash ; always right , as various opposition leader and lead voice in the medium lament the current tension in the relationship would have one believe . Monday & rsquo ; s Security Council resolution be a case in point .",us-israel tensions aren't all netanyahu's fault - analysis
"the tension and clash in Jerusalem , particularly the video from Friday night show israeli police in al - Aqsa Mosque , have lead to the first condemnation of Israel from the country & rsquo ; s new Gulf partner . & nbsp ; Bahrain condemn israeli force for the & ldquo ; attack on worshiper at al - Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; the UAE have call on Israel to de - escalate tension in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; Bahrain also have be concern about the eviction of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah . it doesn & rsquo ; t want the peace process or stability in the region undermine , and it want provocation to stop . it want tension reduce as Ramadan conclude after a difficult month of clash . & nbsp ; the statement come as Saudi Arabia say it & ldquo ; reject Israel & rsquo ; s plan and measure to evict dozen of Palestinians from their home in Jerusalem and impose israeli sovereignty over they . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; the triumvirate of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and the UAE be important because it be largely accept that Riyadh give the green light to Manama and Abu Dhabi to make peace last year . the Emirates go first , for various reason , even though Bahrain have long consider a peace deal and be push coexistence for year . & nbsp ; the UAE make the first unprecedented flight with humanitarian aid during COVID - 19 in the spring of 2020 . then its ambassador to Washington , Yousef al - Otaiba , write an op - ed in Yediot Aharonot . peace follow soon after as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back down from & ldquo ; annexation & rdquo ; of the West Bank . & nbsp ; however , the peace deal , which move quickly in August and September , hit some hurdle . there be question about F - 35 sale , and US president Donald Trump lose the election in the US . this take the wind out of the sail of Saudi Arabia & rsquo ; s consideration and of several other country that might have jump on the peace wagon . & nbsp ; there be consideration about reconciliation after year in which country have a transactional relationship with the Trump administration . under Trump , Washington have signal that human right be not an issue . there be no pressure on Israel regard palestinian issue . on the contrary , there be a & ldquo ; peace to prosperity & rdquo ; plan . & nbsp ; the plan be unveil on January 27 , 2020 , but aspect of it have be push in 2019 . the US Embassy have be move in 2018 .

Ramadan begin on April 21 , and with it come clash . & nbsp ; nevertheless , the positive relation with the Gulf have continue . UAE Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Al Khaja pen an op - ed at Yediot about his first month in Israel . & nbsp ; however , the scene at al - Aqsa Mosque last Friday be the kind that cause tension in the region . Iran , Hezbollah and Hamas have slam Israel in the day lead up to the clash . Turkey and Qatar be prepare statement to slam Israel . the US be express concern and demand de - escalation . european country be follow the tension closely . & nbsp ; instead of listen and try to reduce the clash , israeli security force wade into they . whether that be due to political uncertainty in Israel , with Netanyahu & rsquo ; s rival gain in influence , or other issue be not clear . & nbsp ; the security cabinet meet for the first time in month on April 18 . a new crisis after shoot attack in the West Bank have lead Israel to bolster force . Hamas have fire rocket and threaten more . Israel be hold a large drill prepare for a multifront conflict . & nbsp ; could gulf tie be strain by this convergence of trouble ? so far , the statement be what be to be expect : concern and some mild condemnation ; a desire for stability and for Israel to listen . the question be whether Israel will listen . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s relatively cold official relation with Jordan and Egypt , combine with good security relation that largely go unnoticed , be the opposite of the positive tie and human - to - human connection with the Gulf that see Israelis flock to the region to take part in conference and discuss business deal . & nbsp ; however , voice in the UAE caution Israel about expect too much and move too fast . they certainly be wary of be use for a two - hour photo op by Netanyahu before an election . & nbsp ; some israeli right - wing voice in Israel , accustom to slam arab state and never listen to regional voice , have pay lip service to peace with the Gulf . but they still show little interest in listen or take to heart the need to reduce tension in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; outside of the statement and Jerusalem clash , Israel and its peace partner in the Gulf have much to work on regard wide issue , such as regional strategy and tie with Greece . there be new deal and initiative move forward . & nbsp ; there be coexistence . however , the Jerusalem tension be the kind that require sensitive handling and show respect for the concern of other , a type of language that Jerusalem have not often use in recent year . & nbsp ; with a new administration in the White House , electoral uncertainty in Israel , and Iran , Turkey , Hamas and Hezbollah chomp at the bit for a showdown with the jewish state , many challenge be in the air , of which the Gulf & rsquo ; s concern about Jerusalem be just one .",could jerusalem crisis put strain on israel-gulf ties? - analysis

"the decision by the Defense Ministry to designate six palestinian NGOs as arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization quickly develop into an international storm , with the US , the UN and the EU raise objection and question the validity of the move . & nbsp ; on Monday , European Union Representative to the Palestinians Sven K & uuml ; hn Von Burgsdorff visit the six palestinian NGOs Defense Minister Benny Gantz have target . on Wednesday , representative of 25 israeli nongovernmental group pay a solidarity visit to the Al - Haq office in Ramallah to voice their opposition to the designation . two divergent narrative emerge in the wake of the decision . in one reality reside Gantz , the Defense Ministry and pro - israel NGOs , subscribe to the reality that long - ignore terrorist activity cynically cloak in the guise of human right have finally be unmasked . the other narrative consider the six NGOs to be human right organization and consider the designation to be a draconian attack on palestinian civil society . & nbsp ; on one side , you have Prof . Gerald M . Steinberg , president and founder of NGO Monitor , who say : & ldquo ; there & rsquo ; s no justification for not consider or ignore or overlook the terrorist connection . these be not trivial . People & ndash ; Israelis & ndash ; have be kill . & rdquo ; on the other side , there & rsquo ; s Samer Sinijlawi , chairman of the Jerusalem Development Fund and Fatah activist from Jerusalem , who say : & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s just a blind war against all voice that be criticize the occupation and the abuse of the human right of the Palestinians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; which reality be true ? be Israel try to suppress palestinian civil society , or be it a legitimate grievance against terrorist organization ? after review the importance of the NGOs and their terrorism connection , where one fall seem to be a matter of priority . PFLP affiliation the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine be a marxist military group recognize as a terrorist group by most of the western world . & nbsp ; Israel claim that Addameer , Al - Haq , Bisan Center , Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine ( DCI - P ) , Union of Agricultural Work Committees ( UAWC ) and the Union of palestinian Women & rsquo ; s Committees ( UPWC ) be part of a PFLP terrorist network that recruit , provide legitimacy to operative , and serve as a leadership wing for the PFLP . they & rsquo ; ve be accuse of funnel funding to terrorism through forgery , laundering , and the awarding of stipend to the family of terrorist . & nbsp ; the government hasn & rsquo ; t provide much information to prove its allegation . but little have be do to dispute they other than to note the group & rsquo ; status as human right NGOs . this leave everyone else to make sense of the diverge reality . the NGOs have reject the claim , but group like NGO Monitor assert that there be enough open source documentation to prove that the only thing under attack be terrorism . Al - Haq establish in 1979 and base in Ramallah , Al - Haq be an award - win NGO with connection with dozen of international human right bode , which describe itself as a human right NGO that & ldquo ; document violation of the individual and collective right of Palestinians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Al - Haq be the first NGO that draw Steinberg & rsquo ; s suspicion of PFLP connection , & ldquo ; and in many way be the most significant , of the one that be recently designate as terrorist organization , & rdquo ; he say . & ldquo ; Al - Haq be head by Shawan Jabarin , who sit in israeli jail for a while , be convict of be an activist member of the PFLP , & rdquo ; say Steinberg . & ldquo ; the court rule that he be a human right worker by day and a terrorist official by night . & rdquo ; accord to NGO Monitor , in 2018 , Visa , Mastercard , and American Express shut down online donation to Al - Haq due to PFLP tie . Al - Haq assert in a statement that the & ldquo ; baseless allegation & rdquo ; seek & ldquo ; to delegitimize , oppress , silence & rdquo ; palestinian NGOs . it argue that the decision be not base on security concern , but come due to & ldquo ; the opening of an International Criminal Court investigation . & rdquo ; Sinijlawi find it suspicious that & ldquo ; these organization be lead the procedure in the ICC , where Gantz himself be the main target because he have be the chief of staff in 2014 . & rdquo ; DCI - P found in 1991 , DCI - P be a palestinian child right organization that provide legal support to palestinian minor in the israeli and military court system . & ldquo ; we reject the recent designation as another unjust action by israeli authority to criminalize and eliminate our lawful human right and child protection work , & rdquo ; say Khaled Quzmar , general director of Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine . & ldquo ; when year of delegitimization and disinformation campaign against we have fail to silence our work , israeli authority now choose to escalate repressive tactic by label civil society organization as terrorist . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; we & rsquo ; ve identify five or six different people at different level of the organization that have be active in the PFLP , & rdquo ; say Steinberg . & ldquo ; one in particular be the coordinator of DCI - P & rsquo ; s Community Mobilization Unit , Hashem Abu Maria . & rdquo ; Abu Maria be kill in a clash with the IDF in 2014 and , accord to NGO Monitor , be call & ldquo ; a leader & rdquo ; by PFLP . the designation be not the first time that DCI - P have face charge of terrorism . Citibank and Arab Bank PLC reportedly cease provide service to DCI - P over PFLP link in 2018 . Addameer the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association , establish in 1991 , work and advocate for Palestinians in israeli prison , & ldquo ; offer free legal aid to political prisoner , & rdquo ; and run social campaign . & ldquo ; they defend mostly PFLP , the people who be accuse in the israeli legal process , & rdquo ; Steinberg note . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the designation represent an unprecedented & amp ; ominous attempt by the israeli occupy authority to silence and criminalize palestinian cso that challenge Israel & rsquo ; s prolong military occupation , & rdquo ; Addameer tweet . accord to Steinberg , Addameer & ldquo ; have a number of staff member who be connect to PFLP . the founder , ( Abdul - Latif Ghait ) be a member and activist . the former vice chairman . . . Khalida Jarrar . . . she be define as the head of the PFLP operation in the West Bank . & rdquo ; NGO Monitor claim to have identify at least five other PFLP member in Addameer & rsquo ; s rank . Bisan Center the Bisan Center for Research and Development specialize in socioeconomic right and community engagement . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it should be note that Bisan Center for Research and Development be an independent , nonpartisan center that be not affiliate with any political entity , & rdquo ; Bisan say in a statement on its Facebook page . & ldquo ; this announcement [ of the terrorist designation ] come after concert effort in the israeli occupation & rsquo ; s attempt in a defamation campaign lead by the israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs , & rdquo ; it continue . & ldquo ; the most recent [ Bisan ] executive director . . . be sentence for 12 month for recruit activist , & rdquo ; say Steinberg . & nbsp ; Ataraf Rimawi , identify by NGO Monitor as Bisan & rsquo ; s previous executive director , be note in a court ruling as a & ldquo ; PFLP member & rdquo ; who & ldquo ; pose a security threat . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; UPWC the UPWC be & ldquo ; a progressive mass feminist organization that be establish in 1980 , & rdquo ; accord to its website . & ldquo ; and they have five individual that we & rsquo ; ve identify on the payroll as PFLP people , & rdquo ; say Steinberg . & ldquo ; one of the founder of the PFLP . . . be the president of the UPWC . so again , the connection there be pretty strong between [ the UPWC and ] the PFLP . & rdquo ; Israel be not the first to identify UPWC as a PFLP arm . in 2015 , Fatah identify the UPWC as a PFLP affiliate , as do USAID in 1993 . UAWC among the large agricultural institution in palestinian society , UAWC be establish in 1986 to promote palestinian agricultural development . & ldquo ; they run agricultural project in Gaza and in the West Bank , & rdquo ; say Steinberg . & ldquo ; and that & rsquo ; s their excuse . that & rsquo ; s the justification for the large amount of funding . they get million from many different european country . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; UAWC reject and condemn Israel & rsquo ; s unsubstantiated allegation direct at UAWC and the other NGOs , which be politically motivated . it be tell that the israeli government refuse to release any & lsquo ; evidence & rsquo ; substantiate these allegation , & rdquo ; the NGO tell the Jerusalem Post . & ldquo ; we have identify seven [ PFLP - affiliate ] individual that have various position [ in UAWC ] , & rdquo ; say Steinberg . & ldquo ; a number of they have be sentence in Israel , and , of course , Samir Arbid be stand trial ; he be their accountant . & rdquo ; Arbid and Razak Farraj , another UAWC member , be arrest for their role in the 2019 terrorist attack that kill Rina Schnerb . & ldquo ; there be hundred of employee who have work and continue to work at UAWC and thousand of volunteer , & rdquo ; say a UAWC representative . & ldquo ; UAWC , like any other organization , be not responsible for any individual action of any former and current employee . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; we should not forget that Arbid and Farraj have be expose to horrify torture to pressure they to give confession , & rdquo ; say the representative . as with UPWC , Fatah and USAID document that UAWC be a PFLP affiliate . NGO Monitor have far note that due to Arbid & rsquo ; s and Farraj & rsquo ; s affiliation , the Netherlands suspend funding to the organization . & nbsp ; the UAWC representative assert that the funding be suspend only because of & ldquo ; NGO Monitor & rsquo ; s large incitement campaign against UAWC . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; the representative dismiss the usaid designation , say that the USAID & ldquo ; report [ in which UAWC be designate a PFLP affiliate ] be publish before the arrival of the Palestinian Authority , and it be a report that talk about the beginning of UAWC and its work , which be all voluntary . & rdquo ; a few bad egg ? the main evidence for proponent of the designation doesn & rsquo ; t come from the government , but from NGO investigation show overlap of PFLP member within civil society . & nbsp ; Sinijlawi argue that there be a few flaw in perceive NGOs as terrorist organization base on a few individual . the NGO could be unaware it have terrorist in its rank . & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think that , by law , any NGO need to get a security clearance for any person to get employ . if somebody submit the cv and he & rsquo ; s qualified for a job , he get it . & rdquo ; even if the NGOs be aware , while some country do not differentiate between military and political wing , these NGOs may have . & ldquo ; there could be a military wing inside the Popular Front , but it do not mean that every student activist . . . be involve in a certain type of violence or military action . & rdquo ; while some of the NGOs may have have violent actor , & ldquo ; it do not mean that this organization be totally involve into terrorism , & rdquo ; say Sinijlawi . & ldquo ; to blame the whole people because of someone relate directly or indirectly to these NGOs . . . it & rsquo ; s a trick that anybody will buy . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s not just that they & rsquo ; re member . . . it & rsquo ; s high - level staff , & rdquo ; say Steinberg , dismiss that it & rsquo ; s a few bad egg & ndash ; & ldquo ; in some case , the head of the organization , the people who control the money . & rdquo ; besides the pattern of NGO employee be PFLP operative , Steinberg note , PFLP / NGO activist often hold multiple position in different NGOs , include in umbrella organization . & ldquo ; there & rsquo ; s a broad framework call PNGO , palestinian NGO umbrella Organization . these organization be all member of the pngo , and the head of the pngo generally have be a PFLP official . & rdquo ; NGO or terrorism ? & ldquo ; what do anybody mean by Palestinian & lsquo ; civil society , & rsquo ; particularly when these organization be very clearly part of a network which be not just terrorist , but it & rsquo ; s also part of the PLO structure ? & rdquo ; Steinberg ask . & ldquo ; what make these organization civil society ? & rdquo ; the NGOs & ldquo ; be very important for Palestinians , & rdquo ; say Sinijlawi . the designation be tantamount to & ldquo ; shut down the democratic dynamic inside palestinian society . & rdquo ; on its part , PFLP have not dispute its connection to the NGOs . & nbsp ; PFLP political bureau & rsquo ; s Kayed al - Ghoul have say that Palestinians be & ldquo ; proud of the affiliation of any of their son with any national faction that resist the occupation , include the & rdquo ; PFLP . the negative reaction to the terrorism designation show how important these organization be to Palestinians and their ally . & nbsp ; year of terrorist activity in the midst of palestinian NGOs show that when it come to terrorist in their rank , the prevail sentiment in the response from the international community , palestinian activist , and international body be that you need to break a few bad egg to make an omelet . the two reality may not be so irreconcilable . the NGOs and the terrorist group be interconnect , and while palestinian civil society may be under attack & ndash ; that may also be legitimate . & bull ;",palestinian ngos: human rights workers or agents of terror?
"one recipe for a successful military operation be to clearly define goal beforehand , accomplish they , and then end the operation before expand those goal and risk getting bogge down . as of Tuesday evening , Operation Home and Garden & ndash ; base on these criterion & ndash ; can be consider successful . the stated goal be to target the terrorist infrastructure in Jenin and degrade the terrorist & rsquo ; capability . the IDF successfully knock out terrorist command center , uncover weapon lab and arm stockpile , kill nearly a dozen terrorist , and apprehend 10 time that number . it also signal that it be ready to end the operation swiftly . the success of the campaignThe campaign seem successful at an operational and tactical level : well plan and effectively execute , with no IDF fatality as of Tuesday evening and minimal harm to non - combatant . prevention need to be the next goalbut what come next ? what happen the day after the troop leave Jenin ? this question can be divide into two part : operational and strategic . operationally , once the IDF leave Jenin , it must prevent the terrorist from rebuild the infrastructure there and pose a threat to the country . it must prevent they from build workshop for produce roadside bomb and lab for manufacture primitive rocket . & nbsp ; the IDF also need to prevent the Jenin refugee camp from again become a sanctuary for terrorist carry out attack on the road in Judea and Samaria . the relatively small number of terrorist kill or apprehend in this operation & ndash ; the IDF have identify an additional 350 armed terrorist gunman in the city beyond the 120 arrest & ndash ; indicate that they evade the IDF soldier . they hide but do not vanish , and once the IDF leave they be likely to be even more motivated to carry out attack . to prevent the terrorist from launch attack or rebuild the terrorist infrastructure , the IDF will need to go back into Jenin again and again . this can not be a one - time operation because its effectiveness would rapidly diminish . in a perfect world , or at least in a world run accord to agreement reach under the Oslo Accords , the Palestinian Authority security apparatus would be do this job . but because the PA security apparatus be not fulfil its responsibility , & nbsp ; the IDF have to operate in its place . this mean the IDF will need to go into Jenin more frequently to keep the terrorist from have freedom of movement and action . after the IDF withdraw from Jenin , the security force must brace for retaliatory attack of the kind carry out by a lone terrorist in Tel Aviv on Tuesday afternoon . additionally , they must be prepare for jewish revenge attack in response to these terror attack . such action , like the rampage by jewish extremist in palestinian town follow the murder outside of Eli two week ago and in Huwara early this year , be not only morally reprehensible and wrong but also sap international legitimacy for the type of military action take by Israel in Jenin , and which may become more frequent . as Israel take action to prevent the buildup of terrorist network in the West Bank , encourage and support by Iran , Hamas , and Hezbollah , it must also be ready to strike at target in Gaza and Lebanon if terrorist organization there launch rocket toward Israel in a show of solidarity with Jenin . that the recent fighting do not spread to other front this time do not guarantee the same outcome if similar action be take in the future . Israel need to define strategic goalsall that be on the tactical and operational level . on a strategic level , Israel need to define its goal . while the IDF spokesman clarify Operation Home and Garden & rsquo ; s goal over the last few day , emphasize that the aim be to target the terrorist infrastructure without occupy and remain in Jenin , a similar diplomatic goal be not articulate . the IDF want to degrade the terrorist organization & rsquo ; s capability in Jenin , but what happen afterward ? what be Israel & rsquo ; s vision for Jenin ? do it want the Palestinian Authority to regain control of the city ? if so , what political , diplomatic , or financial incentive be it willing to give the Palestinian Authority to motivate it to reassert its control ? in addition , Israel must determine how far it be willing to go and what action it be prepared to take to weaken Hamas , which be the Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s main rival . during a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting last month , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that while Israel want to eliminate the palestinian aspiration for statehood , it & ldquo ; need & rdquo ; the Palestinian Authority and can not & ldquo ; allow it to collapse . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; we be prepared to help it financially . we have an interest in the Palestinian Authority continue to work , & rdquo ; he say . follow the Jenin operation , Netanyahu must define what exactly that mean and outline the step he be willing to take to strengthen the pa so it will have incentive to regain security control in area like Jenin . when Naftali Bennett be prime minister in 2021 , he speak of & ldquo ; shrink the conflict & rdquo ; with the Palestinians . this mean increase palestinian sovereignty through build a network of roadblock - free road control by the Palestinians , expand palestinian housing and infrastructure , implement measure to boost the palestinian economy , and decrease Israel & rsquo ; s footprint in Palestinian - control area . although this fall far short of the palestinian aspiration for statehood , it be something . so far , the Netanyahu government have not hold out any diplomatic horizon for the Palestinians , and instead have approve thousand of new housing unit in the settlement and green - light an expedite planning process for more . this reflect internal division within the government . while Netanyahu speak of not want to bring about the collapse of the Palestinian Authority or annex the West Bank , other voice & ndash ; such as those of Bezalel Smotrich & ndash ; advocate the opposite . follow the event in Jenin , Netanyahu need to decide what the government want . if the aim be to collaborate with the Palestinian Authority , action should be take to strengthen it and weaken its enemy . but if the goal be to undermine the Palestinian Authority , Israel should begin prepare to fill the void create when the PA collapse . this week & rsquo ; s action in Jenin offer a glimpse of what may await throughout Judea and Samaria if this be the choose course . & nbsp ;",jenin operation: what is meant to happen next? - analysis

he reveal that the rate of unemployment decrease in the last quarter of 2021 to 13 % , after having reach 18 % in 2019 . this , Shtayyeh say , be due to new job opportunity in the West Bank and work in Israel . a report submit to the ahlc by the Quartet , which consist of the US , EU , United Nations and Russia , note that the PA continue to face a dire financial situation result from diminished economic growth , a mark decline in donor funding and israeli deduction from clearance revenue ( in response to payment make by the PA to family of Palestinians involve in terrorist attack against Israelis ) . in 2021 , the PA & rsquo ; s deficit reach $ 757 million & ndash ; approximately 4 . 4 % of GDP & ndash ; despite GDP growth of 6 % , an increase in gross local revenue of $ 1 . 5 billion and a decrease in government expenditure . during the same year , deduction by Israel from clearance revenue reach $ 282 m . , represent 37 % of the budgetary deficit . & ldquo ; projection for 2022 by the PA portray a similarly grim fiscal situation , & rdquo ; accord to the Quartet report . & ldquo ; despite project 3 % growth in gdp and 8 % in gross revenue , the PA & rsquo ; s fiscal deficit be expect to reach $ 558 m . address that gap will require structural change , internal fiscal reform , improve economic growth , and the resolution of a number of long - discuss but still outstanding israeli - palestinian fiscal file . & rdquo ; Shtayyeh present to the donor a plan that include 21 step for reform relate to administrative , financial , security , social and economic issue . & ldquo ; whatever reform we make , they alone be not sufficient to address the imbalance in the palestinian economic structure , because it be under occupation , & rdquo ; he argue . & ldquo ; therefore , Israel must take measure on its part , and the support of donor country must continue to enable we to continue fulfil our obligation . & rdquo ; Shtayyeh do not refer to the issue of anti - israel incitement . but the plan he present to the donor country argue that , as part of the reform process , the PA will work toward promote and protect the palestinian national narrative and culture . & ldquo ; information about Palestine be be deliberately distort by the israeli occupy authority , and , as part of this process , palestinian folklore , heritage and archaeological artifact be be steal , & rdquo ; the plan state . & ldquo ; a battle be be wage over the narrative dominate the conflict . it be important that our national culture , ground on the palestinian identity , should be consolidate and protect . & rdquo ; the news of Abu Akleh & rsquo ; s death come as Shtayyeh be meet with Roberta Metsola , president of the European Parliament , and other EU official on the sideline of the ahlc meeting . the widespread condemnation of the incident have since be use by Shtayyeh and other palestinian official to garner additional support for the Palestinians & rsquo ; case , promote the palestinian narrative , and shift the blame onto Israel . the ultimate goal : to ramp up the narrative accord to which the Palestinians be the & ldquo ; victim of the israeli occupation . & rdquo ; in a statement from Brussels , Shtayyeh write that & ldquo ; Shireen be kill by the israeli occupation while document their horrific crime against our people . & rdquo ; he later urge the senior EU official to pressure Israel & ldquo ; to stop all its unilateral measure and violation against our people and to allow the holding of election in occupy Jerusalem . & rdquo ; it & rsquo ; s not clear at this stage whether Shtayyeh be successful in persuade the donor country to resume or increase their financial aid to the Palestinians . the killing of Abu Akleh may significantly contribute to the Palestinians & rsquo ; diplomatic and medium warfare against Israel , but it will not necessarily bring more money into the coffer of the PA . the Europeans and other western donor have , at least in the past few year , be exert heavy pressure on the PA to end the incitement and tone down its rhetoric against Israel . for now , it & rsquo ; s evident that the pressure have prove to be ineffective . in fact , it seem that matter have be go in the opposite direction . the voice and message emanating from Ramallah and the Hamas - rule Gaza Strip have become even more toxic , as evidence before and during Ramadan . allegation that jewish settler be & ldquo ; storming & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; desecrate & rdquo ; the Aqsa Mosque during their tour of the Temple Mount be sound almost every day in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . senior PA and Hamas official don & rsquo ; t miss an opportunity to accuse Israel of plan to & ldquo ; commit crime & rdquo ; against one of Islam & rsquo ; s holy site , Jerusalem , and the palestinian people . against this backdrop , terrorist attack be carry out in Beersheba , Bnei Brak , Tel Aviv , Elad and Jerusalem . the attack , which result in the death of 19 people , be say to be connect , directly and indirectly , to the tension at the Temple Mount and Jerusalem . yet , just as the tension and violence appear to be fade away , the incident involve the popular Al Jazeera journalist take Israel and the Palestinians back to square one . the PA , Hamas and other palestinian faction and party be now use the tragedy to far whip up anti - israel sentiment among the Palestinians . the protest against the killing of Abu Akleh be likely to continue in the come day and week . the protest , which coincide with the first anniversary of the Israel - Hamas war , could escalate during the Palestinians & rsquo ; annual commemoration of Nakba Day on May 15 in protest against the establishment of Israel . the PA be now hope to turn the tragedy of the reporter into a new version of the incident involve Mohammed al - Durrah , the 12 - year - old boy who be kill in the Gaza Strip in 2000 after be catch in a crossfire between the IDF and palestinian security force . the main goal be to increase the international pressure on Israel to halt all its practice in Jerusalem and the West Bank , include construction in the settlement and security measure at the Temple Mount . the PA & rsquo ; s effort be direct mainly toward the US and the EU . PA President Mahmoud Abbas want the Biden administration to & ldquo ; end its silence & rdquo ; and increase its involvement in the israeli - palestinian conflict . he want the Biden administration to exert crush pressure on the israeli government to stop all IDF & ldquo ; incursion & rdquo ; into palestinian city and village . he also want the Biden administration to fulfill all its promise to the Palestinians , especially the commitment to the reopening of the US Consulate in Jerusalem . on the other hand , Abbas and his official want the EU and other western donor to unconditionally resume their financial aid to the PA . meanwhile , there & rsquo ; s grow concern in Ramallah over the rise influence and popularity of Hamas and palestinian Islamic Jihad in the West Bank . while it & rsquo ; s true that the IDF crackdown on Hamas and PIJ member serve the interest of Abbas , it nevertheless underscore the weakness and alleged collaboration of the PA with Israel . each IDF operation and each killing of a palestinian further erode the palestinian public & rsquo ; s confidence in Abbas and the PA . for now , all eye in Ramallah be set on the upcoming visit of Biden to the region . the PA be hope that Biden will carry with he a number of gift for the Palestinians . the talk about the possibility that the US president may visit a hospital in east Jerusalem without the presence of israeli security officer have already send a positive message to the PA & ndash ; namely , that the US consider east Jerusalem as the capital of a future palestinian state . but the PA know that a visit to a hospital carry more symbolism than substance , which be why Abbas have make it clear that he expect the Biden administration to & ldquo ; translate its word into deed & rdquo ; and fulfill all its promise to the Palestinians without delay . Abbas & rsquo ; s main message to the Americans and Europeans be : submit to my demand , or the Palestinian Authority will collapse , and you will have a Hamas takeover of the West Bank .",pa is ramping up the 'victims of the israeli occupation' narrative

ISRAEL have largely keep Hamas isolate and ossify in Gaza since the 2014 war . cut off from many supply by Egypt , it have few friend . it have try to expand that dwindle support abroad in 2019 and 2020 through visit to Turkey , Malaysia , Qatar and Iran . however , Israel & rsquo ; s new relationship in the Gulf appear to show that Israel be now accept in the region and a new alliance with Greece and Cyprus could promise new energy deal .

Israel have hold election on March 31 and continue to be divide . it be the fourth election in two year . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu do little to form a coalition . a ray of hope be the rise of Ra & rsquo ; be and its head Mansour Abbas . he look willing to join an opposition coalition after break from the Joint List . by May 5 , President Reuven Rivlin have task Yair Lapid with form a government after Netanyahu fail once again to create a coalition .

Hamas have perfect this over the year with various rocket attack at sea , practice for this scenario . it also show off new long - range rocket with a range of up to 250 km . , target Eilat and perhaps Dimona as well . it know that a syrian S - 200 have be fire that trigger alert near Dimona on April 22 . & nbsp ; with iranian support , there be attack in the North as well . on May 13 , rocket be fire into the sea from Lebanon and protester lay siege to Israel @ @ @ s border with its northern neighbor on May 18 . it may have come from Iraq . rocket fire on May 19 even fly near Kiryat Yam , near Haifa . this be a serious incident . it follow the April 27 downing of a Hezbollah drone . & nbsp ; now Hamas and Fatah activist be battle over Al - Aqsa , as clash show on May 23 , and Hamas be say that its war have harm the Abraham Accords . & nbsp ; it & rsquo ; s not clear whether Hamas know its plan would work or the degree to which Iran advise Hamas on this strategy . it be also not clear if the benefit to Hamas and Iran be merely a lucky turn of event for they and that timing dictate the need to go to war but the result be far from certain . clearly , Hamas didn & rsquo ; t have much to lose . Israel , on the other hand , have much to lose and it have diminish return from its year of sink cost in Gaza . Iran and Hezbollah want to test Israel & rsquo ; s defense . it increasingly appear Israel walk into a trap in Gaza . it be a trap partially of Israel & rsquo ; s own making due to not have a new government and have strategic planning concentrate in Netanyahu & rsquo ; s office without check and balance and broad security cabinet discussion . & nbsp ;",did israel walk into a hamas trap in gaza?

People understand that , & rdquo ; Netanyahu say , as he appeal to western power to intervene in an attempt to halt such action . he speak one day after ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announce that he seek arrest warrant for top israeli and Hamas leader , include Netanyahu , and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for crime against humanity due to IDF action in the Gaza War . & ldquo ; that have to be stop . and that have to be resist . and I can assure you , the vast majority of Israelis and all responsible leader in the world understand that this should be resist , & rdquo ; he say . the ICC pre - trial chamber have yet to approve Khan & rsquo ; s request . if it do , the warrant would be the first issue against leader of a democratic country . Israel and the United States be not among the 124 country that be party to the Rome Statute which govern the ICC . if warrant be issue Netanyahu and Gallant would risk arrest if they travel to any of those country , the norwegian news site Nettavisen report that the country & rsquo ; s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide say that if the warrant be issue , his country would arrest Netanyahu and that he believe all the other signatory to the Rome Statute would do the same . Netanyahu tell ABC he be not worried about the threat of arrest . & ldquo ; I be not concern at all about our status . I think that the prosecutor should be concerned about his status because he be really turn the ICC into a pariah institution . & ldquo ; People be just not go to take it seriously . they see it as a politicize thing .

Khan be & ldquo ; create a false symmetry between the democratically elect leader of Israel and the terrorist chieftain , & rdquo ; Netanyahu say . it & rsquo ; s akin to an ICC Chief Prosecutor seek arrest warrant for both US and Al - Qaeda leader in the aftermath of the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001 , Netanyahu say . it be also akin to the issuance of warrant against both former US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and former german Chancellor Adolf Hitler , he add . this be & ldquo ; a hit job . it & rsquo ; s not serious , & rdquo ; Netanyahu say . fan the flame of antisemitismHe accuse Khan of & ldquo ; pour gasoline on the fire of anti - Semitism that be spread around the world because he be attack the one and only jewish state & ldquo ; which be fight an existential war against Hamas .

"Israel have begin what look like a limited operation in Rafah , but seven month after October 7 , the parameter have not change . half the hostage have not return , no alternative to Hamas have be allow to emerge in Gaza , Israel & rsquo ; s international standing have collapse , its relationship with the US be on the rock , the economy have take a hit , antisemitism be skyrocket , and much of country be convince the government be prolong the crisis to stay in power . it & rsquo ; s clearly not great . now imagine an alternative universe in which Israel be lead by a morally upstanding patriot who care about the country & rsquo ; s reputation and the fate of Jews worldwide . imagine that the prime minister understand the power of word to do good and of public diplomacy to persuade . and imagine & ndash ; why not ? & ndash ; that this be Benjamin Netanyahu . whether or not a limited hostage deal be somehow reach in the come day , such a prime minister could flip the entire narrative dramatically at any moment by hold an English - language news conference aim at the world and contain honest truth and easy - to - understand message with zero political scheming . for starter , he & rsquo ; d express deep regret over the loss of life in Gaza . & ldquo ; I know it have be severe , although I be not inclined to believe Hamas number . we do our good with a situation in which Hamas use the population as a human fortification unlike any that history have see and seem to seek as much & lsquo ; martyrdom & rsquo ; as possible . Hamas be evil incarnate , and I weep for the Palestinians who be saddle with such maniacal ruler . & rdquo ; that part of the message should be beam to every US college campus . he would make clear that Israel have no desire to occupy Gaza and no intention of compel the population to flee . & ldquo ; we be only there to remove the threat that attack we on October 7 unprovoked , massacre over 1 , 200 people , and promise with great arrogance to do it again . & ldquo ; I ask every Palestinian : what would you have recommend that we do , at that point ? wait for they , then , to do it again ? I & rsquo ; m genuinely curious . be that what you would have do ? & rdquo ; a departure from cynicism and self - righteousness & nbsp ; the prime minister would say these last word without the kind of smirking , self - righteous cynicism we & rsquo ; ve come to expect . he would sound like a mensch , make each listener feel personally address . that & rsquo ; s because the prime minister be no fool and know that empathy beget empathy and sometimes even sympathy . the PRIME MINISTER would , at this point , diverge not only from the style but from the content that have characterize Netanyahu hitherto . he would say he be prepared to end the war right now in exchange for all remain hostage . he would look into the camera and speak slowly word that will be replay on every television station in the arab world : & ldquo ; Dear Palestinians , dear people of Gaza : the war can end right now . this minute & ndash ; this very second . no more death and destruction . life and reconstruction instead . it be the decision of Hamas . & rdquo ; he would make clear that Israel want to engage the world , the region , and the Palestinians in a day - after plan . and he would offer the Palestinians a choice & ndash ; after the hostage have all be release . one option would be for Israel to pull out of Gaza and let the chip fall where they may , which probably mean Hamas will remain in power despite its military degradation . & ldquo ; for we to do this , there be a major precondition . the group must commit itself to never again attack Israel from Gaza & ndash ; not with rocket , not with explode balloon , and definitely not with an invasion by armed barbarian . this must be declare by the Political Bureau in document submit to the Arab League . we understand it be unlikely , but we be give you this choice . if you take it , then something good will have come of this war . I will sell this to the israeli people . let & rsquo ; s see you explain yourself to the people of Gaza . & rdquo ; if Hamas be unwilling to do this & ndash ; and it be close to a certainty that it win & rsquo ; t & ndash ; then it would have a second option as well . the prime minister would explain that Israel would allow the entire leadership of the organization and anyone who participate in October 7 & ndash ; thousand of bloodthirsty fanatic and fool & ndash ; to leave the Strip in a flotilla guard by the United States Navy and head to whatever country agree to take they . Turkey and Qatar be deserve candidate . Israel would undertake not to attack they there in the future as well . here , the prime minister would finally address what Israel would like to see happen in the Strip the day after Hamas . he would jettison the self - defeat boycott of the Palestinian Authority , say that the PA would be invite to return to Gaza , from which it be expel by Hamas in 2007 . he would add that Israel would be hope that the PA revise the problematic school curriculum in which pupil be not educate for peace and that it would need to accept assistance , from Israel or from an arab force , on security in the territory . he would add that Israel would , in exchange for acquiescence in these area , offer extremely significant financial aid to rebuild the Strip and set it on the road to a reasonable degree of prosperity . the prime minister would also mention the elephant in the room & ndash ; the world community & rsquo ; s desire to see a two - state solution in which the West Bank issue be also resolve . repeat word Netanyahu and other israeli leader have say in the past , the prime minister would explain that Israel do not want to forever govern the Palestinians because it aim to be a democratic , jewish - majority country . but he would add that there & rsquo ; s a catch . & ldquo ; what happen on October 7 make it impossible for we to remove the military completely from the West Bank because if that territory fall into the same hand that attack we from Gaza , the damage would be many time great . & ldquo ; for this , you have Hamas to blame . every person who support Hamas support continue a level of threat against we that do not allow progress . therefore , address the security danger & ndash ; which be a real danger for we , and not paranoia & ndash ; be the key . we will be work on this with all our partner , but we need some time . let & rsquo ; s focus first on a real solution for Gaza . & rdquo ; he would conclude with a broad message that will resonate around the world : & ldquo ; palestinian and arab friend , and also enemy : we want peace , but we will not roll over . the jewish people be in Israel to stay . work with we and you will find a supporter and a champion . the past seven month have offer a glimpse of the hell that await we if the radical prevail . let & rsquo ; s instead ensure that this never occur again . & rdquo ; the prime minister will have not commit to anything that Israel should not itself desire & ndash ; but the deck will have be completely reshuffle . even if Hamas reject all the option , among serious people in the world there will be clarity at last , and Israel would have international legitimacy to press on . this be good , because there be no great advantage in dwell alone .

Amidror caution against hyperbole . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think there be pressure , & rdquo ; he say . & ldquo ; I think that what the Americans be say be that they want to see a ceasefire . but that be not pressure . they understand the need for Israel to complete the operation , they understand we be talk about a terrorist organization that cross all redline , open fire on israeli city . therefore the administration give we time . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I make no pretense of understand how America work , & rdquo ; say Amidror , a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security . & ldquo ; I look at what they have do , and what they have do up until now be to give we the time we need . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror say he be not surprise by this , since the leadership in the Democratic Party & ndash ; & ldquo ; contrary to the perception here & rdquo ; & ndash ; still maintain & ldquo ; check and balance over the radical progressive element within the party that sometimes contain antisemitic element . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; what be ironic about Biden & rsquo ; s support be that it have disappoint some on the right , because it disrupt their narrative that Biden be a reincarnation of Barack Obama who will squeeze Israel at the first opportunity , and at the same time have also disappoint some on the Left who would like to see much less support for Israel . & nbsp ; there be also israeli domestic agenda at work among those who want to characterize Biden & rsquo ; s comment as & ldquo ; pressure . & rdquo ; those politically oppose to Netanyahu would like to cast he now in the role as someone on a collision course with Biden and his administration , while the prime minister & rsquo ; s supporter be keen on paint a picture of perfect harmony between the two man who have know each other for nearly 40 year . & nbsp ; but there be objective standard against which to judge pressure to withdraw . here & rsquo ; s one : in April 2002 , just nine day into Israel & rsquo ; s Operation Protective Shield aim at crush the terrorist infrastructure in the West Bank that be responsible for hundred of death during the Second Intifada , president George W . Bush call on prime minister Ariel Sharon to withdraw IDF troop immediately from the palestinian city they have move into . & nbsp ; at a press conference in Crawford , Texas , Bush say , & ldquo ; my word to Israel be the same today as they be a couple of day ago : withdraw without delay . & rdquo ; he add that he expect Israel to & ldquo ; heed my advice . & rdquo ; Sharon didn & rsquo ; t , the military campaign go on for another month , and US - Israel tie survive . & nbsp ; Biden & rsquo ; s expectation of de - escalation and support for a ceasefire do not come near that Bush standard of rhetorical pressure . & nbsp ; AVIV shiron , a recently retire diplomat who previously serve stint as Israel & rsquo ; s ambassador to the Netherlands , Austria and Switzerland , say that in comparison with other round of violence in Gaza in the past , & ldquo ; the international pressure this time be less significant and massive . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we have see the new US president give full support to Israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and do not demand an immediate ceasefire . now he be call for a ceasefire , but we be 11 day into the operation & ndash ; that be very significant . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; also inside the European Union , which be always more critical , there be more country this time that support Israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and do not demand a ceasefire . & rdquo ; he also point out that israeli flag be fly atop government building in Germany , Austria , the Czech Republic and Slovenia as a sign of solidarity . & nbsp ; Shiron attribute this primarily to the few civilian casualty in Gaza than in the past . & ldquo ; the collateral damage be less , and we be see few picture of dead and injured and child , even though there be always civilian casualty . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the number of casualty in Gaza be less because the IDF and the air force have learn lesson from the past , and as a result pressure come from various government be less , & rdquo ; he say . & nbsp ; Shiron maintain that anti - Israel protest on the street of London , Paris , Berlin and Washington always accompany this type of conflict , and that there be little difference in they this time around . as they continue , there will be more pressure on various government to speak out and take a stand , but & ldquo ; all in all thing be well than in previous time . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas take advantage of exist tension in Jerusalem as its pretense for launch attack , and start the current campaign by fire at Jerusalem & ndash ; an act that succeed in both play on and build up passion of Muslims around the world , include among israeli - Arabs , something Hamas certainly deem a & ldquo ; success . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; at the same time , however , Shiron say that fire on Jerusalem hurt Hamas in capital around the world . & ldquo ; when you fire on Jerusalem , as oppose to Sderot , it be perceive differently in the world . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror , who agree with Shiron that Europe have largely give more support for Israel than in the past and allow it to carry out its operation accord to its own timeline , say there be three main reason for this degree of understanding among many world government . & nbsp ; first , he say , be israeli restraint over incident from Gaza in the week before Hamas fire rocket toward Jerusalem on May 10 . second , be that it be clear to the government around the world who start the conflagration . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; and the third thing be that they be shoot at civilian target , while everyone understand we be shoot at military one , & rdquo ; Amidror say . & ldquo ; sometimes we err and civilian be kill , but our intent & ndash ; and the direction of our fire & ndash ; be toward military target , while they be shoot at civilian from among civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror say that even those critical of recent israeli action in Jerusalem , such as effort to evict four family from Sheikh Jarrah and police activity during Ramadan at the Damascus Gate , understand that there be huge gap between the claim of israeli error in this matter and the response . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; there be disproportionality between the claim against we , and the reaction . for the sake of argument , let & rsquo ; s say that they be right , that our behavior could have be gentle in Jerusalem . do that justify rocket on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv ? there be tremendous disproportionality . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; but that disproportionality & ldquo ; play into our hand , & rdquo ; Amidror say , as & ldquo ; reasonable people understand that a terrorist organization take advantage of the situation to fire on civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; while Amidror maintain that the reaction of much of the world overall have not be overly bad , include Russia , China be an exception . there the overseas channel of state broadcaster CCTV air a report shot - full with antisemitic trope . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; . . . . some people believe that US pro - israeli policy be traceable to the influence of wealthy Jews in the US and the jewish lobby on US foreign policy - maker , & rdquo ; say host Zheng Junfeng , ask his audience whether US support for Israel be truly base on share value . & ldquo ; Jews dominate finance and internet sector . so do they have the powerful lobby some say ? possible . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror take umbrage . & ldquo ; there be a big difference between be for a ceasefire and antisemitic claim , & rdquo ; he say . & ldquo ; as someone who very much value the relationship with China , it pain I to see antisemitic claim in China compete with the antisemitic argument of [ turkish President Recep Tayyip ] Erdogan . this be beneath China . & rdquo ;","amid gaza conflict, global response to israel not as bad as on tv"
"two rocket be fire at Israel from the Gaza Strip , one week apart from each other . while the IDF shrug off the first , blame it on bad weather , it & rsquo ; s now clear . it be not a mistake . it be a message . Hamas be under pressure , and it & rsquo ; s get bad . the coronavirus pandemic be wreak havoc in the blockaded enclave , and Hamas & ndash ; which be in no mood for conflict with Israel & ndash ; tend to send message in the form of incendiary balloon or rocket when it be under pressure and need aid . though the group be able to effectively deal with the deadly virus during the first wave , the blockaded coastal enclave be suffer from a harsh second wave of the coronavirus , with more than 5 , 517 total case and 65 death , the majority since September . the Strip & rsquo ; s weak healthcare infrastructure , with few than 3 , 000 bed , be unable to cope with all the sick , and be also see a record number of daily new case & ndash ; on Saturday alone the Health Ministry say there be 891 new case . Fathi Abu Warda , adviser to the palestinian health minister in Gaza , be quote by Wafa news agency as say on Sunday that there be an & ldquo ; unprecedented hike & rdquo ; in the number of case and that the European Hospital in Khan Yunis in the south of the Gaza Strip have reach its limit in receive coronavirus case . thank to the international aid Israel have let into the Strip , Hamas have be able to increase its testing capability from 200 a day during the first wave to 3 , 500 a day , and the number of ventilator have rise to 160 . Abu Warda also say two truckload of & ldquo ; urgent medical aid , & rdquo ; include respirator and medication for those with chronic illness , will enter the Strip in the come day . but it & rsquo ; s still not enough . in addition to the coronavirus crisis , the economy be still a disaster & ndash ; with the unemployment rate in Gaza close to 50 % , with those who be employ earn close to nothing . the average monthly income have fall from $ 244 to $ 29 since March . Israel & rsquo ; s defense establishment and Southern Command have warn several time that there be a direct link between a worsen economy and rocket fire or incendiary balloon . Hamas be also become far isolate , include from the Palestinian Authority , which recently resume security cooperation with Israel follow the victory of US President - elect Joe Biden . follow the resumption of security tie , palestinian security force in the West Bank be expect to renew their arrest of Hamas operative in the territory . the normalization of tie between Israel and Gulf state have also place a strain on Hamas . and that , the IDF fear , will lead to close tie with Israel & rsquo ; s enemy on its northern border & ndash ; Hezbollah . already follow the deal with the United Arab Emirates , Ismail Haniyeh , who head Hamas & rsquo ; s political bureau , meet with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut . there have be more than a dozen round of violent clash between the IDF and terror group since 2018 , with thousand of rocket fire toward Israel and thousand of Hamas and palestinian Islamic Jihad target strike by the Israel Air Force in retaliation . but all of they end without any tangible solution , lead the IDF to change its concept toward a new approach , call & ldquo ; Southern Wind , & rdquo ; which would use high - quality intelligence and firepower to shorten the length of an operation . a new concept be all fine and dandy , but when push come to shove and a large - scale military operation take place , neither side will end up as a winner . you just have to look at the recent history of the military operation in the Gaza Strip where nothing change , except that both side experience more death and destruction . so why do the IDF echo Hamas & rsquo ; s lightning excuse when two rocket be fire toward central Israel ? neither side want a large - scale military operation , and the IDF believe that Yahya Sinwar , Hamas & rsquo ; s leader in the Strip , as well as the head of its military wing , Mohammed Deif , still prefer to follow the status quo and avoid confrontation with the IDF . the rocket fire by Hamas be a message send by Sinwar , a message that have be receive and understand by Israel before . the pressure be rise and something need to be do before the situation explode . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ;","it wasn@@@t lightning silly, the rockets were a message by hamas - analysis"

( re . ) Matti Peled and former Labor Party secretary - general Arieh Eliav , but when shoot he be but one wall away from Shimon Peres , who would become prime minister the following year . & nbsp ; rumor of a plan meeting between the two be probably unfounded , but to the assailant & ndash ; the Abu - Nidal terrorist group & ndash ; that didn & rsquo ; t matter ; Sartawi speak peace , and that make he anathema and his death foretold . & nbsp ; it be part of a pattern , one that neither begin nor end on that sorry day in April 1983 , and in fact lace Israel & rsquo ; s history almost from its birth to these very day of awe ; day which make many assume fatalistically that peace - killer will always defeat the peacemaker . well they haven & rsquo ; t , and they win & rsquo ; t . & nbsp ; the first of the peacemaker to fall in the line of duty be Jordan & rsquo ; s King Abdullah , who be shoot in 1951 at the Mosque of Omar & rsquo ; s entrance after hold secret talk with David Ben - Gurion & rsquo ; s emissary . & nbsp ; two year before Sartawi & rsquo ; s murder , Anwar Sadat be mow down by four islamist gunman who emerge from a truck during a military parade and empty their Kalashnikovs at the presidential podium killing , besides Sadat , another 10 man . the young peace treaty with Israel , though only part of a broad islamist agenda , be a key element in the squad & rsquo ; s motivation . & nbsp ; the following year lebanese president - elect Bashir Gemayel , who have be dialogue with Israel for a while and be widely expect to make peace with Menachem Begin , be blow up along with 26 other during a political meeting in Beirut . the assassin , widely believe to have be activate by syrian agent , cite the alliance with Israel as the cause of his act . & nbsp ; the common denominator among all these assault be the belief that arab - jewish peace , no matter how limited or embryonic , be an abomination that must be nip in the bud . & nbsp ; now this history be once again at play ; not in Hamas & rsquo ; s quest to fight & ndash ; that & rsquo ; s a give that need no pretext & ndash ; but in its timing . Hamas could have start this round of violence long before or well after this month . what make it press the trigger be Israel & rsquo ; s first - ever arab - jewish coalition agreement , which be but several day away from be sign . & nbsp ; the extraordinary Bennett - Abbas - Lapid government be set to inspire a great arab - jewish reconciliation , a prospect that from the viewpoint of Hamas be intolerable . like Sartawi & rsquo ; s evolve dialogue and like Gemayel & rsquo ; s burgeon peace & ndash ; it have to be preempt . hence the rush , scope , and total abandonment of measure with which Hamas unleash its wrath . & nbsp ; Time will tell to what extent the fighting & rsquo ; s spillover to Israel & rsquo ; s mixed town be micromanage by Hamas operative . however , it be clear already now that the rampage in Lod , Acre and Jaffa serve Hamas well , and that whether or not they be conduct from Gaza they be clearly incite from there . & nbsp ; worse , in term of its immediate aim the ploy work . the breathtaking move Naftali Bennett have already introduce with the inspiring statement that & ldquo ; a broad government be not a default , it & rsquo ; s an aim , & rdquo ; be summarily shelve . & nbsp ; like that peace with Lebanon & rsquo ; s elect president which Israel be already touch and smell only to see he and his gospel murder , the great reconciliation that Bennett and Mansour Abbas seem ready to launch be trample , overnight , by thug who lynch pedestrian , shatter storefront , and torch synagogue . & nbsp ; the question this plunge from utopia to dystopia raise be therefore this : can peace survive its murder ? & nbsp ; STRATEGIC surprise be good at what they announce & ndash ; surprise & ndash ; but their planner often fail to plan for what their surprise uncork . & nbsp ; Hitler & rsquo ; s invasion of the Soviet Union , Japan & rsquo ; s attack on Pearl Harbor and Egypt & rsquo ; s crossing of the Suez Canal be stunning . all three , however , be ultimately defeat . Hamas & rsquo ; s strategic surprise be head the same way . & nbsp ; the Germans disparage the Russians & rsquo ; industrial ability , the Japanese underestimate America & rsquo ; s fight spirit , the Egyptians didn & rsquo ; t calculate israeli improvisation , and Hamas doesn & rsquo ; t understand what the sight of a torch synagogue do to a Jew , any Jew , even a leftist , an agnostic or a convert . & nbsp ; on this front the counterattack be already underway , with hundred of arrest that will be follow by harsh indictment that will produce lengthy jail term . & nbsp ; equally swift will be the physical restoration that the peace - murderer & rsquo ; carnage demand . it will take month , but every ruin synagogue , hotel , restaurant and shop will be repair , as will all the vandalize park , playground , plazas and bus stop , not to mention ransack police station . & nbsp ; much more difficult will be the rehabilitation of the surprise attack & rsquo ; s big target : communal relation that be build over generation . & nbsp ; yes , the struggle ahead of we be daunt , the civic version of defend Stalingrad and wrest Iwo Jima , but like those battle , it will end in evil & rsquo ; s defeat . & nbsp ; Anwar Sadat be murder , but the peace he strike survive he , and live to this day . & nbsp ; Mansour Abbas & rsquo ; s emergence in an israeli coalition have apparently be derail , but he still show up at the burn Beit Yisrael Synagogue and , with Lod Mayor Yair Revivo ( Likud ) alongside he , denounce the arson as anti - islamic and vow to participate in its reconstruction . & nbsp ; yes , the arab - jewish coalition which Middle Israelis crave , the situation beg , and nearly half the arab electorate endorse & ndash ; be dead . its spirit , however , live on . & nbsp ; www .

[ she laugh . ] and after the Yom Kippur War , how do you recall Israel ? we all work very hard . we want to build something , and we feel we do . & nbsp ; do you mean your life or also Israel ? also Israel . & nbsp ; so after the war , you start to work in your profession , as a jewelry designer ? yes , at home . People have come especially to I . I look at how a person behave and what he [ or she ] like , and base on that I be design . & nbsp ; before shift to glass sculpture ( which be your main focus right now ) , for 40 year you be create jewelry , show it at professional exhibition in the Netherlands , Israel , and the US , and you be also teach how to design . & nbsp ; yes , I teach design at a technology center for jewelry in Tel Aviv ( 1985 - 1995 ) , and in 1993 at a special program for Bedouin girl and young woman who be make traditional Bedouin jewelry but want to learn about other approach ; and ( in the year 1990 - 2000 ) at Beit Berl art college in Ramat Hasharon , where I be head of the jewelry department . & nbsp ; so you have an establish professional position , and suddenly in 2002 you go to Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design to study glass design . what trigger that ? I be look , for a long time , for something else . I hope that if I have another material , it would be more interesting for I and more creative . my husband , who have be always very supportive of I , see in a newspaper that there be an opening of a new department of glass , as a second degree , at Bezalel . I apply and get accept . it be two year of hard work , but it be very interesting to I to learn various technique of work with glass . it be wonderful , in the middle of my life to start with a new material ! but I have never forget about my metal . the metal always help I to design the inside of the glass . it add the feeling . I have combine it with glass . what attract you to glass ? it can be transparent and doesn & rsquo ; t have to . you can do everything with it , move it in all the direction you want to . another thing , jewelry be also art , but when you create in gold it be [ display ] in a glass box ; people can & rsquo ; t touch it . and I like it when people can touch a sculpture . & nbsp ; it change the experience of the viewer . with your art you reflect on your personal experience , but also on group and social exposure , such as war , the issue of african refugee , or the pandemic . in 2022 , at the Venice Art Bienniale , you show [ the installation ] Covitrum ( covid and vitro , & lsquo ; glass & rsquo ; in Latin ) , a series of glass sculpture & ndash ; unrecognizable portrait , without distinction in gender or skin color . these face be cover with different mask wear during the pandemic . yes , the only distinction be that I make 13 adult and five child ( represent my five grandchild ) , together 18 . I choose this number because of its gematria ; the number 18 mean chai & ndash ; & lsquo ; life , & rsquo ; in Hebrew . & nbsp ; why do you want to incorporate a number important in Judaism , in a way take away from the universality of this project ? it be very important to I because it be a very powerful number . each head be cover with a different mask . in these mask I put the story . a mask be a tool of pretense and protection , and it allow introspection . it give a space to reveal or hide the identity and feeling . one of they be transparent , and I call it & lsquo ; read my lip . & rsquo ; but there be also the israeli flag , the Venice flag , and a rainbow LGBTQ flag mask . & nbsp ; on view in Italy , there be also your sculpture Refugees , dedicate to people who flee their country across the sea in inhuman condition . a huge unresolved issue of african emigrant often lose their life on the way to Europe be express in your powerful sculpture . I want to show the color of the sky and the sea and , in between , human being . the sea be their last refuge . they be mostly black people , so I use the color black and red ( as blood ) . you can see that they be all on the boat , but one be outside & ndash ; didn & rsquo ; t make it . & nbsp ; you respond to this tragic reality with extreme sensitivity . your late sculpture be also very socially engaged . in December 2023 , at a group exhibition & lsquo ; the color of Camouflage , & rsquo ; at the Periscope Gallery in Tel Aviv , you present two series of work : & lsquo ; upside down , & rsquo ; in camouflage military color , and & lsquo ; New Life , & rsquo ; with motif of israeli flag in glass , flow in different shape . in both case , you & rsquo ; ve connect a very smooth and elegant movement of glass attach to very simple and basic metal food can . what be the idea behind this concept ? and do you make this series of sculpture before the war or during the current war ? I start before the war . during the war , my feeling about it be even strong . I be very connected to my grandson , what they do . do they serve in the army now ? yes , three of they . I be very proud of they . & nbsp ; so the color come from your grandson ? yes , although not directly . I be worried , in general . the flag , at first , be connect to the last year & rsquo ; s demonstration in Israel . I want to show the sadness of thousand of people be with a flag during the protest . I be concerned about what would be with this country and what be go on . I be still , I be worried . what do think will be with Israel ? & nbsp ; the future will not be easy . but I think that we be very strong , and we have to be very strong . & nbsp ; we be talk after many month of war , and you be wear a & lsquo ; bring they Home & rsquo ; necklace [ in solidarity with the hostage ] , and you be still say that we be very strong ? this be a very scary and ugly fairy tale . but , of course , we be very strong ! otherwise , we & ndash ; you and I & ndash ; would not be here today . so how do you see the future of Israel now , also with the new wave of antisemitism around the world ? when I listen to my daughter , Tamar and Dafna , they be worried . when I listen to my grandson , they be full of life and they believe that everything will be fine . & nbsp ; why do you connect flag with simple can ? they be real can , reuse . by add a flag to they , there be something new , and maybe there will be something new in the region , not the same as it be before . whatever happen in Israel , I express it in my art , both my jewelry and glass sculpture . but the first reason why I use the can be practical & ndash ; the metal [ material ] and its form . then I realize that I could use different shape of can , which give I new feeling . when I see these sculpture at the exhibition , look at the israeli flag make of glass , I think that this be zionist art . be it okay to call your art Zionist ? I be very pleased to hear it ! do you think there be a place for something like zionist art , that the israeli artist will want to go in this direction ? this be interesting , what you be ask . when I look back at the exhibition ( and this be very important , to look back and check with yourself what you do ) , I ask myself if it be only the obsession of flag . but it wasn & rsquo ; t . in every piece , I put my feeling inside . & nbsp ; how would you name these feeling ? new life . ■ on April 18 at 7 p . m . , at Beit Yad LaBanim cultural center , 2 Hamahteret Street , Ramat Hasharon , a group show will open which will include one of Peiper & rsquo ; s new work , View of Israel . & nbsp ; the artist & rsquo ; s website : chenpeiper2 . wixsite . com / chen",the flag in focus: zionist art

"not many people alive today have do as much for human freedom and the jewish people as have Natan Sharansky .

Sharansky also receive the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1986 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2006 . he be the only live non - american citizen who be the recipient of these two high american award . clearly , there be almost nothing in the jewish world and in Israel that Sharansky have not be involve with , in one way or another , in the course of his life . at this challenging time , it seem appropriate to discuss current event with Sharansky . these be difficult time for we , as a people , as a country , as a society . how have you feel since October 7 ? "" of course , there be a huge failure here of our intelligence , our army , and our politician . we be deeply invest in incorrect concept . for I , it all start back with Oslo . I say then , that the idea of our bring a dictator to the Palestinians who would make peace with we & mdash ; because we would make he a dictator by give he a lot of money & mdash ; do not make sense . it be just the reverse : the dictator would need we as enemy , and therefore would not make peace with we . "" it continue even with the withdrawal ( from the Gaza Strip , A . w . ) . the idea be that we would be here , and they would be there , and we could control they that way . as ( Prime Minister ) Arik Sharon explain to I , if they turn militant and try something , we would go in . I resign from the government at that time , because of the disengagement . "" "" we have become a united society "" Sharansky believe it be the spirit of Oslo that cause Israel 's leadership , at all level , to act incorrectly , and lead to the failure of October 7 . on the other hand , "" this event be a reminder of how good it be that we have the State of Israel . there be a poet who write that the proximity of israeli Memorial Day and Holocaust Day help we understand the price of the world with a state and without a state . when we be in the Soviet Union and there be a surge of antisemitism , could we could fight , go to court ? no ! we just have to get by , take refuge in mathematic and physics , perhaps they would leave we alone . even after 100 , 000 people be kill ( in pogrom ) , there be nothing to be do but to run away to America . "" now , we be fight , "" Sharansky declare proudly . "" we have transform from a most divide society into a united society . we be all sit in one tank , and our appreciation for the State of Israel have be renew . and as much as we call the young generation a tiktok one , it turn out this generation be give we a lesson in true Zionism , in such a noble , such a brave way . so , good thing be happen . I be optimistic about the future of the State of Israel , but far less optimistic about what be happen in America and Europe . "" Sharansky try to explain what he think be happen nowadays in the West , both in the jewish context and the wide one . "" the Jews feel they be part of the liberal world , and the liberal world think the progressive be their partner . for year , I write about the fact that the real crisis in the United States be not between Republicans and Democrats , but between liberal and progressive . I say that one day , the liberal would realize they be not partner . "" in his various role , Sharansky meet with many Jews in the West . "" I ask Jews at university , in the most elite place , if any of the organization they have develop relationship with , befriend over the year , express any sympathy after October 7 . I be not ask for anything more , just sympathy . they look and look , and find one right - lean organization at Yale that participate in mourning . that be it . this mean that all the organization on the progressive left see the terrible thing that happen on October 7 as part of a legitimate struggle . this be a big change ; antisemitism come out in a big way . "" Sharansky say in the past he have theory about how to prove a connection between antisemitism and anti - zionism . "" today we no long need a theory , we do not need to show anything , it be in everyday life . I hope that the new generation of american Jews will go out in public and fight over this it . "" you say you be encourage by the unity here , but there be a repeat of the tension we see before October 7 , be not there ? "" there be a comeback , but a group of politician and a group of journalist be behind it . the masse be not with they today , unlike what happen until October 7 when half the country think the other half be try to steal their democracy and the other half think they be try to steal their Judaism . today , the people feel that it be important for everyone that there be a jewish state , and also a free country , and you can see this with almost every bereaved family of a fall soldier . also , we see that , in the moment of truth , suddenly , the real and deep thing that unite we still exist . they be not lose . "" marxism be backI speak not long ago with a researcher name Izabella Tabarovsky who believe that the anti - zionist rhetoric and progressive left activity stem from the soviet attitude towards Zionism and Israel . do you agree with this analysis ? "" yes , of course . I think Izabella be right . there be a large group of people who leave he Soviet Union who understand much well than most Americans what exactly happen in America . the whole post - modern ideology that divide the world into oppress and oppressor be neo - Marxism in its most primitive form . in the study of critical race theory & mdash ; which have become the Koran of the progressive & mdash ; if you replace race with class , you get the ideology of the Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union . there , too , the whole war be between one good side and one bad side , between the proletariat and the capitalist . the capitalist be always wrong and should not be give freedom of speech & mdash ; aside from those who be consider politically correct . and the capitalist world should be destroy completely , and a just world will be build on this . it be very sad that Marxism have come back after such a huge failure . it have come back via the academy because it could not come back through politic . it be always like that , the bad idea always come from the academy . "" when do I first realize that this be what have happen ? "" Sharansky ask , and immediately answer : "" twenty year ago , I be tour university in America , and I tell Arik Sharon , who be then prime minister , that this be where the most important struggle for Israel 's future be take place . I see there for the first time that student be afraid to say what they think because it would not be good for their career . and as soon that start , it start take we towards soviet life . "" how do you overcome this madness ? "" liberal student , first of all jewish student , should enter the arena , stand up , and take a strong position . a position that say we be Jews , we be Zionists , Zionism be part of our identity , and the United States , accord to its principle , must protect we . it be already start ; 500 student in Columbia issue a very firm letter , and every day more student be join , and I believe it will reach more university . in addition , there be now investigation into how Qatar give ten of billion of dollar to university . this must be investigate .

"the continued reality that 90 % of adult haredi ( ultra - Orthodox ) male be exempt from national service have no moral , halachic , or security justification . this be true before October 7 and have become a critical issue since . having form part of the debate during the period of legal reform before the war , it be now a burn public issue . there be many people responsible for the fact that the haredi community have be exempt for the 76 year since the creation of the State of Israel , start with David Ben - Gurion and include pretty much every government since . but in the very real - world crisis in which Israel find itself , the issue have crystallize due to the huge sacrifice make by conscript and reserve soldier since October 7 and the army & rsquo ; s need for more combat force . with the immediate and long - term requirement for battle - train soldier go up , the haredi leadership be double down on its rhetoric . currently , the only thing stand between real change in government policy and the untenable status quo be the political need of the prime minister , back by the religious zionist party in the government . it be time for the moral masse on the political and religious right to call their leader out and demand a change of course . the fact that any change will take time to have an impact only increase the urgency for action . the country need more soldier , in particular combat soldier . in order to achieve this , the army be demand that conscript soldier extend their service and that those in reserve be call upon for extended period of service for the foreseeable future . there be a limited number of population that can provide additional pool for recruitment , namely , female soldier ( whose number in combat role be on the rise ) and haredi man . the government be in a bind . public opinion be now strongly and emotively against any extension of the blanket exemption for over 60 , 000 haredi yeshiva student , and on the other hand , the government be politically beholden to the haredi party , which as yet remain firm in their resistance . the law allow for the haredi exemption actually expire in June 2023 , and now there be several case before the Supreme Court call for two measure as a result . one be to force the Defense Ministry & rsquo ; s hand and start call up haredi man , and the second be to halt any financial support for the yeshivot , with student now legally require to enlist . both outcome be political causus belli for the haredi party . raise the age of exemptionin an attempt to stave off these sanction , the government be mull a decision that will , among other thing , increase the age of exemption to 34 . this mean that any haredi not perform national service will not be legally allow to work until they be 34 . currently , the age be 26 . this will turn the clock back to 2010 . Dr . gilad Malach of the Israel Democracy Institute be an expert on government policy on conscription and haredim . he note that , in contrast to what be now be claim by the government , not only will this not increase the number of haredim join the IDF but it may cause the opposite . accord to Malach , all the datum show just the opposite . & ldquo ; history and experience have show we that it will also have a negative impact on the quality and quantity of the haredi participation in the employment market . the later haredim seek training or employment , the less likely they will be able to train for highly skilled work , & rdquo ; he say . alternatively , reduce the age of exemption cause more haredim to seek employment at a young age , with the ability to skill up in order to exploit the opportunity . instead of raise the age , Malach and all the expert would prefer that the government reduce it . Yoav Gradus , director - general of the Budget Department in Israel & rsquo ; s Ministry of Finance , issue a letter to the defense minister on Sunday , follow the publication of the propose government decision . report in the press stress that the decision be be drive without the normal professional input from relevant government ministry , which only increase the sense that the decision be purely political , without any real prospect of a positive impact on either increase participation in the army or the economy . in the letter , he be quite specific : & ldquo ; from an economic point of view , the condition connect the non - conscription of man and their non - integration into the labor market lead , as mention , to the creation of employment pattern that produce long - term damage to the entire economy . & rdquo ; Shaked reflect on decade of failurein a stunning and unusually candid moment from an israeli politician , former minister of justice Ayelet Shaked , who be closely involve in the conscription law pass in 2014 , admit that all her hope for the law and the process it be mean to create have fail . & ldquo ; at the time we pass the law , the annual haredi cohort of boy number 8 , 000 , and 1 , 200 be conscript . after 10 year , we didn & rsquo ; t reach ( our target of ) 6 , 000 . indeed , the cohort have grow to 12 , 000 , and the number of conscript be 1 , 800 , & rdquo ; she tell a recent conference at Tel Aviv University . in the meantime , the army & rsquo ; s need have grow dramatically . & nbsp ; no magic bulletthere be no easy fix to this entrench problem . nobody expect or believe that masse of haredim will join the IDF immediately , no matter what policy be employ by the government . however , the need to shift course be now . at the very least , the government have to begin the process . for this to happen , one of two thing will have to occur . either the Likud and the Religious Zionist Party will have to force the issue with the haredi party or there will have to be election with the ball drop into the lap of the next government . urgency demand that this happen under the auspex of the current government . politic determine that this be an unlikely outcome . for the first to happen , Netanyahu and Smotrich will have to switch course , the risk be that the haredi party will bolt the coalition and the government will fall . on the other hand , Gantz , Eisenkot , and perhaps Defense Minister Gallant can force their hand by either demand a different policy or deliver an ultimatum to leave the government . of course , election will delay the process . one way or another , there will soon be irresistible public pressure for change . this will have to include reduce government budget support yeshivas for haredim who do not serve and increase budget for haredi institution and program that encourage national service , whether military or civilian . the government must support school teach core study and social responsibility and reduce budget to school that be not prepare their student to make a full contribution to israeli society . & nbsp ; nobody want to see Haredim stop be loyal to their religious identity , but most Israelis be in no mood to see the status quo extend . the writer , a found partner of Goldrock Capital , be the founder of the Institute for jewish and Zionist Research . he be a former chair of Gesher , World Bnei Akiva , and the Coalition for Haredi Employment .","haredi draft issue has made no progress, but it must - opinion"

Aner Hellman of the Attorney - General Office & rsquo ; s High Court of Justice division argue during the hearing that the part of the law regard investigation need to be strike down as unconstitutional since it do not include provision to protect citizen from violation of human right . Hellman add that the part of the law give the minister the ability to set policy should also be strike down unless the court clarify what exactly qualify as & ldquo ; policy . & rdquo ; accord to Hellman , & ldquo ; policy & rdquo ; must be define in advance and can not be set during a specific addition . moreover , the legality of these policy decision must first be deem legal by the ministry & rsquo ; s legal adviser . a lawyer for Ben - Gvir , Adv . Nadav Haetzni , argue in response that the fact that Ben - Gvir have make controversial policy decision since take office do not mean that the law itself be unconstitutional . accord to Haetzni , the minister should have the right to set general policy , and if the minister give specific operational order , these could be challenge in a separate process in the High Court . in reference to this , Hellman and other argue that illegal operational directive give by Ben - Gvir could not always be appeal in real time and that the potential for human right violation be serious enough to render the law unconstitutional . the law should especially clarify that the police , and not the minister , be responsible for make decision in real - time regard protest against the government . Ben - Gvir attend part of debateBen - Gvir attend part of the debate and at one point even interrupt his attorney , say that he would not agree to be a & ldquo ; plant , & rdquo ; I . e . , a passive observer of the police & rsquo ; s action . this continue a claim make by Ben - Gvir on Tuesday that outgo Israel Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai and the Attorney General & rsquo ; s Office be collude against he to prevent he from apply his policy . indeed , the hearing come during an ugly public spat between Shabtai and Ben - Gvir . Shabtai complain to the attorney - general in recent week that , on numerous occasion , the national security minister have illegally bypass he and speak directly to lower - rank police officer . Ben - Gvir , in turn , accuse Shabtai of not function properly since the result of the Mount Meron tragedy report be make public in March . the report find several official , include Shabtai , former public security minister Amir Ohana , and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , personally responsible for the catastrophe in which 45 haredim be crush to death during a mass Lag Ba & rsquo ; omer event at the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in 2021 . shabtai himself attend the hearing and wish to speak , but the judge deny his request . Shabtai instead speak to reporter outside . & ldquo ; I come here today out of a deep concern for the future of the Israel Police as a professional , apolitical & rdquo ; member of the police , without any specific agenda , Shabtai say . & ldquo ; I do not come here against some minister or other . I come simply to present our position about the significance and consequence of this law . expand the authority [ of the minister ] could affect democracy in the State of Israel , & rdquo ; he emphasize .","high court begins hearing on ben-gvir law, police chief expected to oppose"
"a month after Operation Guardian of the Walls , the IDF continue to struggle to maintain calm in the West Bank . with Israel & rsquo ; s attention focus on the Gaza Strip , the flame of violence in the West Bank be at risk of explode . & nbsp ; accord to datum release by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , there be 592 attack in the West Bank and another 178 in Jerusalem in the month of May , compare to a total of 104 in April ( 80 in the West Bank and 24 in Jerusalem ) . the May attack include 401 firebombing , 33 pipe bomb , 87 arson attack , 47 small - arm fire , two grenade attack , one vehicular attack and other . & nbsp ; one israeli civilian , Yehuda Guetta , be also kill in a shooting attack at the Tapuah junction in early May by 44 - year - old Muntasir Shalabi . & nbsp ; Most of the attack that take place be not carry out by group but by lone wolf . those kind of attack , the IDF have admit , be much more challenging to thwart than attack plan by group . if you don & rsquo ; t have an organization , you don & rsquo ; t have the signature of the preparation of the specific attack . & nbsp ; despite the challenge , the great majority of attack have be thwart by security force . but the high number of thwart attack also indicate that the flame of violence be grow in the West Bank . & nbsp ; while there have be significantly few vehicular attack as well as stabbing and shoot attack against IDF soldier , they remain a major threat , especially toward driver on the road share by both Palestinians and Israelis . & nbsp ; accord to the IDF , shoot or vehicular ramming attack be more likely to be carry out by young man , and child be behind many case of stone throwing . & nbsp ; along with the high number of attack against israeli target , a report by Ynet news find that 34 Palestinians be kill over the past month , & ldquo ; more than during any month in the past 10 year . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; compare the past month to the height of the wave of knife and vehicular - ram attack that take place in 2015 - 2016 , an average of 26 Palestinians be kill every month . & nbsp ; so what & rsquo ; S happen ? & nbsp ; with the cancellation of the May palestinian election in late April , the public have lose all faith in their leader who they say have abandon the cause a long time ago .

"against the backdrop of the ongoing 46th day of the war against Hamas , the question arise of how the terrorist organization perceive the large - scale ground operation carry out by the IDF in the Gaza Strip . in a conversation with Yinon Magal and Barak Seri on 103FM , Zvi Yehezkeli , the head of the Arab Desk at Channel 13 , comment on the mindset of Hamas since the outbreak of the conflict . what be they think when they commit the horrific massacre on October 7 ? "" kill Jews be Yahya Sinwar 's strong instinct . we be currently in the midst of a military operation , with the army actively engage , showcase an incredible fighting spirit . "" now , let us discuss the future . as long as there be a political entity in the Gaza Strip , you will always have Hamas . you can not eradicate Hamas ; it be deeply engraine in the palestinian identity , more so than Fatah or anything else . if the situation in the north Gaza Strip be to replicate itself in the south Gaza Strip & ndash ; with refugee seek protection elsewhere and find host country & ndash ; leave the Gaza Strip without Hamas and a large population will be impossible . "" it be either Hamas or the people . eventually , whoever govern the Gaza Strip will never accept your existence . no Palestinians , in any form , neither the Palestinian Authority nor a reformed Authority , will acknowledge your presence . "" what do you propose for the day after ? "" what have happen in Gaza can also happen in the West Bank . we have a zero - sum game with the Palestinians , and if we fail to realize this , it will consume we . even in Judea and Samaria , my friend , it be just a matter of time . "" just ask the resident of settlement ; they know this be come their way . Palestinians pass by the fence warn we , ' we will do to you what they do to you in Gaza . ' I receive call from Haredi individual live in Beitar Illit , tell I , ' the Arabs be come , and Gaza be a precursor . ' "" understand that something have fundamentally change regard palestinian existence . they have achieve what Nasrallah do in 2000 ; they manage to enter , kill , and massacre , and we do nothing . "" do witness the ongoing event in Gaza not make they think twice ? "" their concern be not for the resident . Yahya Sinwar do not care that two million people have become refugee . it simply do not matter to he . he believe it be a noble cause , something great than himself , and it would be a miscalculation if he do not pursue it . "" hence , even if you push it towards the West Bank , even if it be true that Abu Mazen do not incite they for jihad , the public will . be Jenin no long like Gaza ? be Nablus no long like Gaza ? these be small place that have embrace jihad . Jihad hold great significance for they than anything else , even if it bring they down and backfire . "" Yehezkeli also say , "" Gaza , before the massacre , be in a state of development . they build infrastructure and thriving building . yet , they be willing to destroy all of it , reduce it to rubble , just to fight you . they know that eventually , you will feel remorse over their situation and leave . "" there be an arabic saying , ' if you want your stock to rise , deal with a Jew . they will always take care of you . ' the mercy of the Jews be something Arabs praise & ndash ; their compassion . they know we will not turn the table ; they know we be merciful . a soldier say to I , ' Jews kill to survive , while Arabs live to kill . ' that be the difference . "" "" every day the token fall to we , we be in the Middle East . this war be not a month or two , I think something strategic have happen here , the State of Israel be about to go through a huge process for the next few year . you will not stop see soldier here in reserve and with weapon . "" this will not end friend , it will not end in Gaza , it will continue to Judea and Samaria . we have many more arena . what , do you think that Nasrallah have finish his story ? "" he ask . part of the argument for not launch a preemptive strike and a second front against Nasrallah and Hezbollah be that "" we will dismantle Hamas "" so that those in the north will see what we be do and not want to enter . be you say it make no impression on they ? "" if you end Gaza in a ' wow ' way , everyone will step back and say , ' listen , the Jews do something that be beyond their nature , and that be it . ' "" what be beyond nature ? "" what be beyond nature ? that no palestinian refugee remain in the Gaza Strip . "" what ? where will the two million go ? "" 200 , 000 to 10 country , what be the problem ? Germany take in four million syrian refugee , Europe take in another two million , Lebanon take in two million from Assad , Jordan take in Egypt . those who protect the Palestinians all the time , what be the problem if they take some Palestinians ? what be the problem ? why can not they ? "" you will not be able to establish your control and for the State of Israel to be safe , as long as you have an entity there that will always threaten you . or you will once again build shield and protect room , etc . "" how be Dahlan ? be he plan to return to Gaza ? "" I do not know . he be a star in Israel and among the Americans , but I think they do not understand either . everyone who take care of the Gaza Strip in recent year must hold themselves accountable .

Leon Hirsch , head of the Operational Coordination Section in the Police Intelligence Division . & ldquo ; the Israel Police have also record significant achievement in file indictment for these crime which constitute a significant nuisance to the public in arab community . since the operation begin , there have be a much high demand for police service , and we see this in the response we receive from the resident , & rdquo ; he add . seize weapon , arrest criminalsdure this period in 2022 , ten of thousand of weapon , explosive , ammunition , grenade and other illegal item be seize in town of arab community , include 770 handgun , and more than 100 submachine gun and 350 gun of different type , thousand of item of ammunition , as well as hundred of grenade , weapon part and explosive & ndash ; a significant increase when compare to the same time period in 2021 . the operation have be carry out so far in 19 locality , include Haifa , Umm el - Fahm , Nazareth and Rahat . after almost half of 2022 have pass , datum show that the extensive operation launch by the police to eradicate violence result in success & ndash ; at least partially : until June 5 , 31 people in the arab community be murder in Israel , include four woman , compare to 50 murder in the first half of 2021 ( up to May 27 to be exact ) . in total , accord to police datum , since the beginning of the year , 42 people have be murder throughout the country , of which , as mention , 31 be from arab society . so far the police have solve only 12 murder case in the arab sector this year . the police attribute this decrease in the number of murder in the sector to the operation . murder on the risedespite the effort police have put forward , some remain skeptical about the actual effect they have , as murder case in arab society continue to rise , hit 55 murder up until July , accord to datum from independent NGOs . while police action be at the forefront of the operation , it be much large in scope when look at from a broad lens . effort of the Finance Ministry and income tax official , for example , set out to combat money laundering and illegal loan , which in turn entangle many civilian . & ldquo ; many arab town in the North don & rsquo ; t even have a bank or any other mean of legally handle financial affair . leave out of option , they turn to organize criminal syndicate , & rdquo ; Ola Najami - Yousef & ldquo ; many arab town in the North don & rsquo ; t even have a bank or any other mean of legally handle financial affair . leave out of option , they turn to organize criminal syndicate , & rdquo ; Ola Najami - Yousef , vice president of the Abraham Initiative NGO , which track crime in arab community , tell the Magazine in an interview . the issue , she explain , be much large than a simple lack of policing . the arab community have long face neglect from all governmental office , from finance to education . resident be often leave to their own device , something that leave a large vacuum for criminal to fill . arab be view as a security threat themselvesbefore Safe Route be initiate , Arabs be view as a & ldquo ; security threat themselves . even though a lot of these issue be well known to the government , nothing be do , until now . & ldquo ; the way arab society be view and discuss have change ; we & rsquo ; re no long social pariah , and a wide range of effort be now be undertake to give arab community what they rightfully deserve as israeli citizen , & rdquo ; she say . the problem with crime in the community often stem from this large perspective that paint Arabs as a collective threat . even if a plain citizen get entangle with criminal element on account of a lack of service , he have no one to turn to when thing turn sour , a situation that not only leave an opening for crime on its own but also severely hurt the community & rsquo ; trust in the police , far increase the reign of criminal . in town like Nazareth , where Najami - Yousef live , you could hardly notice police presence , and town like Jisr e - Zarka didn & rsquo ; t even have a functional police station , even though the building for it exist . now , police be make effort to increase their presence , understand that the lack of trust from local severely impact how well they could combat crime effectively . the change be certainly be feel . Jasser & rsquo ; s police station , which have be vacant until now , be fully staff , and town like Rahat and Nazareth be see more patrol car on the street . Najami - Yousef , a resident of Nazareth herself , even state that & ldquo ; you could even hear less gunfire in Nazareth these day . & rdquo ; to further the bond with the community , the Abraham Initiative have organize meeting between teen and police officer from local station . the change , Najami - Yousef say , be slowly start to take effect . but when look at the still high murder rate which claim the life of 11 Arabs in the last month , one could question the effectiveness of this change . & ldquo ; these thing take time , & rdquo ; Najami - Yousef explain . & ldquo ; it may take up to five year until we would see a practical change in murder . & rdquo ; Najami - Yousef even theorize that the late chain of murder could be a direct response to police effort , with criminal organization feel the pressure and , in turn , attempt to clean house . Police official claim , on the other hand , that the operation have attain significant achievement , and that the decrease in the number of murder be feel & ldquo ; everywhere & rdquo ; in the arab sector . one of the reason for this , accord to they , be that budget be now be divert to combat violence in the sector , make it possible to strengthen the force station in the arab community and also recruit Arabs directly to the police . & ldquo ; in the last five year , 800 Muslims have be recruit to the Israel Police . today the police can react quickly when case of violence occur , & rdquo ; a police official say . & ldquo ; along with the continuation of enforcement and its deepening , in order to deal with the phenomenon and completely deter it , a multisystemic treatment and a deep - root change beyond police enforcement be need , & rdquo ; say Ch . - supt .

"& nbsp ; Fakhri Abu Diab live in east Jerusalem , but everything he know about Israel & rsquo ; s capital be different from the one that his jewish neighbor love . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; anyone who come to east Jerusalem know that it be not the same city and not the same language , & rdquo ; say Abu Diab , who be a spokesman for the Silwan neighborhood . & nbsp ; the barrier that once divide Jerusalem prior to 1967 have long since be tear down . fifty - four year have pass since Israel create a united capital when it wrest control of the eastern part of the city from Jordan during the six Day War . & nbsp ; next week , as Israel celebrate Jerusalem Day to mark that victory , few will remember where that barrier really stand , but the scar of the division still resonate in the city . & nbsp ; at issue be not just the cultural and linguistic difference between the palestinian population that largely live in east Jerusalem and make up 39 % of the municipality & rsquo ; s 900 , 000 people . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; geopolitic play a role . Most of the international community support a divided Jerusalem , where the eastern part of the city would be the capital of a future palestinian state . an additional complicate factor be the fact that most of the Palestinians have Jerusalem residency but lack israeli citizenship . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; but over time , for many jewish Israelis , the difference have almost begin to appear cosmetic . they walk around a city that easily look united and whose redivision seem unrealistic and unfeasible . & nbsp ; for Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan - Nahoum the city & rsquo ; s unity be obvious . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Jerusalem be a city comprise of community . that be the essence of Jerusalem . it be a city of community , but it be a united city . what make it unite ? you have one municipal authority take care of all of its resident , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; that authority be in charge of transport , health , education and public space , she add . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; that municipal authority , especially in the last few year , have make it a point of be an inclusive authority , where everyone have a voice , and where everyone can approach the mayor and the deputy mayor and can advocate for their community and receive resource for that community , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; on a public level , what we have see in the last five to 10 year be a city that be more integrated than it have ever be . ten year ago , you never have a young arab student work in Fox , & rdquo ; Hassan - Nahoum say , add that many of the shop throughout the city be staff by arab resident . & nbsp ; today , public space be share by jewish and arab resident of the city , include in coffee shop and gym . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; whether people admit it or not , whether the detractor can still point finger at the divided city & ndash ; in essence , in the day - to - day experience for most people , & rdquo ; the city be integrate physically , logistically and relationally , she say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think our work be finish , & rdquo ; she say , add that more need to be do on issue of equity and job placement , particularly in the hi - tech industry , but that be true with respect to any community that have be marginalize , she say . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; for many year the government of Israel , whether leave or right , do not know what to do with the issue of east Jerusalem , Hassan - Nahoum say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the Left think one day it will be the capital of a palestinian state , and the right wing be concern with other issue , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; partially , she say , the problem lie with the Palestinians themselves . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we have a hostile community , with little leadership , manipulate by the palestinian leadership in Ramallah . it be difficult . I be not say it be all their fault , but I believe we be in a different place now . the Arabs in east Jerusalem be realize that they be get zero , nothing , from the palestinian leadership , she say . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; she credit Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion and former Jerusalem Affairs minister Ze & rsquo ; ev Elkin , now a New Hope MK , for make stride in close the equity gap between jewish and arab resident of the city , include the development of partnership with the local arab leadership . & nbsp ; when riot break out a few week ago , Lion , who be Sabbath observant , walk on Saturday to meet with community leader to seek a way to calm the situation , she say . & nbsp ; the city & rsquo ; s unity be most clearly apparent , she say , during the COVID - 19 pandemic , when everyone band together to fight a common enemy . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it be beautiful . it be a difficult time , but we come together as a city and that be the measure of how far we have come , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the DNA of Jerusalem be one of diversity , & rdquo ; she say , as she explain that King David choose this space to build this city 3 , 000 year ago because it do not belong to any one tribe and thus it could be a place where everyone could gather together . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; our dna be one of convergence , of east and west , of old and new , of past and future and heaven and earth . we will solve all of the conflict in our country and in our region from Jerusalem , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; the EXECUTIVE director of the left - wing NGO Ir Amim , Yudith Oppenheimer , say that , factually speak , Israel annex east Jerusalem in 1967 and since then it have be manage by one municipality . & nbsp ; on the surface , & ldquo ; you can look at Jerusalem and say here be an urban space in which people can move from one place to another , so maybe this be a united city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer say . & nbsp ; but & ldquo ; when you look deeply into the situation , you see that the city be actually divide in many aspect , and each one portray a picture of two very unequal society , in which one control the other , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer add . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; one side have all the resource and be very dedicated to express its hegemony , & rdquo ; and the other side lack those resource , she say . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; the issue , she say , start with the fact that most of the city & rsquo ; s palestinian resident lack israeli citizenship and have only residency right . those right be conditional and can easily be remove , she explain , add that this insecure status dominate many aspect of their life , she say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; everything be conditional . they may not leave the city ; they may lose their residency status . they can not build in the city , but they have to live in the city , or they lose all their entitlement to the city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer say . & nbsp ; Palestinians have individual right in Jerusalem but not collective one , she say . & nbsp ; Oppenheimer dismiss claim that the Palestinians be to blame for this situation because they refuse to take citizenship . & ldquo ; this be an urban legend , & rdquo ; she say . Palestinians be never offer collective citizenship , but rather the right to apply individually and that application be very complicated . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it take year and many be deny , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; those who do not want citizenship should be offer permanent residency that can not be easily revoke , so that they can live their life more securely , she say . & nbsp ; the issue of inequity be the main issue , she say , and that issue be separate from the final political status of Jerusalem , which need to be negotiate between Israelis and Palestinians , she explain . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; so be the city united ? & rdquo ; she ask . it & rsquo ; s those who speak so highly of unity that seem to want it the least , she say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; do they really want for Jerusalem to be unite in a meaningful way , in the full meaning of what it mean ? because their action actually say the opposite , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; her organization , she say , support a two - state resolution to the conflict in which Jerusalem would be the capital of both an israeli and a palestinian state . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; but this doesn & rsquo ; t mean that the city have to be physically divide , & rdquo ; she say . & ldquo ; it be get more and more difficult to divide the city . if you ask , the majority of the resident actually enjoy the diversity that the city offer and do not want to see the city divide again . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; there be creative way to create two capital without physically divide the city , and the sustainability of a two - state solution depend on the capacity of Israelis and Palestinians to share the municipal public space in the full way possible , Oppenheimer say . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; the issue be not about divide the city but about share it , she say . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we be actually work very hard not for a vision of divided or unite , but for a vision of share city , & rdquo ; she say . & nbsp ; Abu Diab say it be clear to he that the city be divide . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the food be different , even the dream be different , & rdquo ; he say . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; here they [ Palestinians ] know they be live under occupation , & rdquo ; say Abu Diab who do not consider himself unify with the jewish resident of the city . & ldquo ; we think they be not live with we and that they want to live without we , & rdquo ; he add . & nbsp ; he have never seek israeli citizenship , nor do he want it . he dream of be a citizen of a future palestinian state in which east Jerusalem will be its capital . but this doesn & rsquo ; t mean he imagine that a wall would divide the city , but , rather , that the city would be govern by two different entity , with its citizen walk freely between both . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Jerusalem belong to everyone . it should be a city of love and peace and nonviolence . it should be an international city , but allow for everyone to be part of their own people , & rdquo ; he explain . & nbsp ; SARA HAETZNI - COHEN , who chair the right - wing NGO my Israel Movement , say that obviously Jerusalem be Israel & rsquo ; s united capital and , as such , all effort must be make to ensure that this be true in practice and not just a slogan . & nbsp ; to make that happen , she say , the issue of inequity between the eastern and western part of the city must be address and it must be the right that lead that charge . & nbsp ; failure to do that , she say , give an erroneous message that israeli sovereignty in east Jerusalem be temporary . there be little reason to invest in neighborhood that will one day be give away . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Israel have to make a statement of sovereignty by normalize its treatment of those neighborhood , include offer israeli citizenship to the Palestinians who seek it , she say . & nbsp ; otherwise , Palestinians have the feeling they be temporary here , Haetzni - Cohen say . & nbsp ; from the start , Israel make a decision to apply sovereignty to the city , and now it should shore up that sovereignty , she say . & nbsp ; to not recognize this reality , she say , be to & ldquo ; put one & rsquo ; s head in the sand . & rdquo ;","jerusalem day: 54 years later, is the city united or divided?"

"last week see an interesting discussion around China play a possible role in peacemaking between Israel and the Palestinians . the discussion illustrate China & rsquo ; s grow role in the Middle East . after China help broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran , it appear that Beijing could solve many problem by pose as an outsider with no real agenda or baggage . China & rsquo ; s foreign minister indicate that Beijing could play a role in Israel - palestinian peace talk , accord to report last week . he have separate call with Israel and the Palestinians , the Guardian report . & ldquo ; the separate phone call between the chinese foreign minister , Qin Gang , and the israeli and palestinian top diplomat come amid recent move by Beijing to position itself as a regional mediator , & rdquo ; the report say . accord to an article at Al - Ain medium in the UAE , for many year , & ldquo ; China maintain good relation with the Palestinians and the Israelis , but it do not present itself as a mediator to resolve the conflict between the two party . & rdquo ; China have now play a role bring Saudi Arabia and Iran together , however , so why not tackle another area of tension , the report say . & ldquo ; Israel consider the United States to be the exclusive mediator in its conflict with the Palestinians , and have always reject European , UN and russian mediation , & rdquo ; it say . it appear the Palestinians think the Chinese might play a positive role . this be raise by Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al - Maliki last week . however , China be now perceive as a rival by the US , and Washington have be clear to Israel and other country that they should be wary of China & rsquo ; s influence , especially as that might relate to sensitive technology . this be at the heart of several controversy over the year , such as China invest in port or communication . because Israel have such close tie to the US and israeli defense company have many US partner , there be an increase spotlight on China & rsquo ; s role in the region . in fact , China & rsquo ; s grow influence in Israel appear to peak a few year ago . China be reach out to the Palestinians . Beijing say it support the PA , seek to continue assist the Palestinians and back the two - state solution . the Chinese say they would welcome visit by palestinian official . so how would China facilitate peace talk with Israel and the Palestinians ? so how would China facilitate peace talk with Israel and the Palestinians ? consider how China sign a 25 - year deal with Iran recently , be it an impartial actor today ? the global shift that be take place in the wake of COVID and Russia & rsquo ; s invasion of Ukraine may have change thing so much that Beijing would find it to be an uphill struggle these day . nevertheless , China appear to have message discipline on this issue . it have speak to Israel and the Palestinians . chinese President Xi Jinping appear serious . there be several way this could develop , and China could try to mediate more and play a large role . this will put Israel in an awkward position . if Israel appear to not be interested , it could cause China to see Israel in a negative light and begin to invest more in tie with the Palestinians and Iran . Tehran have interest here as well . Iran & rsquo ; s agenda be to undermine the PA and spread chaos in the palestinian city via weapon smuggling . China be officially against militant , terrorist and chaos . Beijing claim to want stability in the region , and it want deal between party in conflict so that it can develop trade relation . China have be talk up its Belt and Road Initiative for year . this be suppose to knit the region together in economic term . however , once again , the russian war in Ukraine and US - China tension have change thing . Russia & rsquo ; s war accelerate process in international relation , which mean it accelerate China & rsquo ; s confrontation with the West . despite France & rsquo ; s outreach , Beijing be indicate it support Moscow undermine the global rule - base international order . Beijing continue to make comment about the baltic state that cause dismay in the West . on the other hand , as the Belt and Road Initiative may not be as important these day , because the world be more divided , and China & rsquo ; s soft , quiet and consistent approach to influence building in the region have shift , it & rsquo ; s not clear if the economic - stability model be even relevant . for instance , for many year , we be tell that link Russia & rsquo ; s economy to Europe would reduce the chance of war . in the end , this globalization neoliberal agenda fail because China and Russia have show that despite economic link , they have become more nationalist , authoritarian and hostile to the West . thus , democratic peace or Belt and Road have not come to fruition . therefore , how will China & rsquo ; s talk of broker peace deal come to fruition ? for China , the role of mediator be bolster by it not have a major historic role in the region . on the other hand , it suffer from decline perception of neutrality in the region as it play a great role here . that mean country all pour into China their hope and belief of what it might be to the region , and as with all diminish return and feedback loop , it will inevitably come up short because you can & rsquo ; t be all thing to all people . the region have a history of have expectation and then be angry when they aren & rsquo ; t meet . at the same time , China doesn & rsquo ; t have a long historic track record of mediation or solve conflict . the US , despite its baggage , do have a long role of help end conflict . this go back more than 100 year , when Teddy Roosevelt & rsquo ; s administration helped end the Russo - japanese War . China & rsquo ; s track record close to home at end conflict do not bode well for peacemake in the region . a more powerful China be clearly rise , and it be willing to take risk , such as work with the Saudis and Iranians . that may not mean that what it achieve in those talk can be replicate .",could china serve as broker of israel-palestinian peace? - analysis

Eylon Levy and Douglas Murray ■ a video in which former government spokesman Levy be see interview Douglas Murray be do the round on social medium . though Levy be fiercely pro - Israel , Murray may be even more so . the two don & rsquo ; t agree on everything and argue a lot , but in a fairly civilized manner , which make the interview more interesting . what they have in common , other than their attitude to Israel , be their beautifully modulate british accent . both be Oxford alumnus , and both be journalist and author .

Abu Toameh & rsquo ; s story , with a slight change of the name of some of the official quote inside , could have be write in 2005 , 2010 and 2015 . it be as if time have stand still , as if the Palestinians have a set diplomatic menu from which they call in an order from time to time . nothing have change . not the threat to scrap Oslo , stop security cooperation with Israel or lobby the world to step up the pressure on the jewish state . one staple on that menu that be not mention this time , at least not yet , be that Abbas would resign , something he have threaten to do & ndash ; but have fail to deliver on & ndash ; numerous time in the past . what be clear from these tired threat , and the same old pattern of action & ndash ; say all sign agreement will be cancel , go to Moscow , threaten to revoke recognition of Israel & ndash ; be that the PA have no idea what to do next diplomatically . the diplomatic process have grind to a halt , the Americans & ndash ; realize that it be not go anywhere right now & ndash ; have push it way down their list of priority , and the PA leadership have no idea of how to further its aim . so it revert to the default option : threat . there be two problem with that option , however . the first be that these threat have be issue so often in the past that they simply don & rsquo ; t move anybody . they be empty . and the second problem be that use these threat have not work . the PA leadership have not move any close to its goal by threaten to break off agreement with Israel or get an international conference convene . issue these threat may serve a domestic political need to flex a muscle from time to time , to show the home audience that the leadership be do something , but it be have exactly no impact on israeli policy , and not do much either in term of mobilize international involvement . all these threat do be demonstrate that the palestinian leadership be out of idea . short of complain that Israel be an apartheid state commit ethnic cleansing and try to get the International Criminal Court to step in , it have no fresh proposition to put forward . not , mind you , that the israeli government be burst with they . but it be try to put forth a more constructive approach , though other will argue that the recent announcement about a plan to advance construction of more than 3 , 000 home beyond the Green Line be anything but helpful . even there , however , that announcement be precede by approval of some 1 , 300 unit for Palestinians in the West Bank , as well as the granting of legal status to some 4 , 000 Palestinians live there & ndash ; type of & ldquo ; constructive gesture & rdquo ; toward the Palestinians not see in year . this be all part of an idea that have take hold in the Bennett government of & ldquo ; shrink the conflict , & rdquo ; make life for the Palestinians easier , improve the economic condition in the West Bank , and promote economic independence there , even while acknowledge that an overall peace settlement be nowhere in the offing . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett have not take this idea , develop by Micah Goodman & ndash ; who reportedly have Bennett & rsquo ; s ear & ndash ; as far as Goodman would like , but it be still something . Goodman & rsquo ; s idea be for more than just an & ldquo ; economic peace , & rdquo ; but actually for Israel to give the Palestinians more area to control , a direction that Yair Lapid could conceivably follow if / when he become premier in August 2023 . even if Bennett be not go as far as Goodman might like , he be still push something positive . the PA leadership , on the other hand , be just go back to the same slogan and the same method , vainly hope that this time they will render a significantly different result . they win & rsquo ; t . some new idea , new thinking , new approach be badly need out of Ramallah . the PA need to come up with something well than the & ldquo ; same old , same old , & rdquo ; because that have prove to be a path lead nowhere .","the palestinian ‘same old, same old’ is getting them nowhere - analysis"

Netanyahu & rsquo ; s medium team know how to put he in the limelight when they want to : they use video statement , picture , write statement , and often a mix of all of the above . in this case , a write statement from the Likud party , not the prime minister himself , show that the prime minister intend to keep himself as far away as possible from the report & rsquo ; s conclusion . the content of the response follow this theme . it begin , & ldquo ; the Meron disaster be tragic , our heart be with the family of the victim . in practice , the government have already implement the require conclusion , and the last event at Meron be hold with a large crowd and without fault . the government will examine the need to implement additional operational lesson to prevent a repetition of a disaster such as this . & rdquo ; the statement then move on to accusation : & ldquo ; however , it be unfortunate that for the first time in history , the government lead by Bennett and Lapid form a committee of investigation against its predecessor in the political right , and in which a central member be a confidante of Lapid , Shlomo Yanai , who receive an offer for a spot in the Yesh Atid Knesset list . this be a completely distinct political provocation . Lapid & rsquo ; s cynical and intentional attempt to turn the Meron disaster into a political tool will not succeed . & rdquo ; this response be criticize by member of nearly all of the political party , include the Likud itself , as well as by a forum that represent the family of the victim , who call it & ldquo ; disgraceful . & rdquo ; it be worth note that member of the National Commission of Inquiry be choose by then - chief justice Esther Hayut , not by the Lapid - Bennett government . the Netanyahu government at the time of the disaster drag its foot in form the committee , and at first attempt to form a governmental or parliamentary committee , which would give it some power over the identity of the committee member , as well as reduce the impact of its conclusion . furthermore , the Likud & rsquo ; s response do not mention that Yanai be a retired IDF Major General , a recipient of the IDF & rsquo ; s Medal of Distinguished Service , a former ceo of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , and , accord to Haaretz reporter Yossi Melman , be Netanyahu & rsquo ; s choice to head the Mossad in 2010 ( which Yanai turn down ) . nor do the response mention the other distinguished member of the commission & ndash ; former Supreme Court President Miriam Naor , who be replace by Tel Aviv District Court president Devorah Berliner , and Rabbi Mordechai Karelitz , former mayor of Bnei Brak . instead of at least acknowledge the fact that Netanyahu be find to bear personal responsibility for the disaster , the response attempt to discredit the member of the committee . other than say that the government will examine whether there be any more lesson to implement , the response do not address any of the sweeping systemic failure that the committee find lead to the disaster & ndash ; nor the fact that these failure be exacerbate during the decade before the disaster , during which Netanyahu be prime minister . Likud respond similarly to October 7the response be indicative of how the Likud have respond to the October 7 massacre . at least on two occasion , the Likud put out immediate response to report intelligence failure lead up to the massacre , in which it say that Netanyahu be not aware of the intelligence and that he be not forewarn by IDF official . the prime minister have promise that there will be a committee of investigation , but it be not clear when such a committee will be form . in addition , since the October 7 massacre , he mention the word & ldquo ; responsibility & rdquo ; in just one press conference & ndash ; and say that he be & ldquo ; responsible for the future of the State of Israel , & rdquo ; which imply that he be not responsible for event in the past . the government be slam with responsibility for the failure of October 7 , and at first , the word & ldquo ; responsibility & rdquo ; be utter by no one ; slowly , that change . IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi say it first , follow by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich . Netanyahu still have not . a direct line link the Likud & rsquo ; s response to the Meron report and its statement since the October 7 massacre : Netanyahu be not responsible , and whoever claim so have political motive . this be likely to continue , and it be thus not clear how and when those who bear responsibility for the event of October 7 will be hold accountable . & nbsp ;",likud's response to the meron report is indicative of what's to come - analysis
"as international actor debate the legitimacy of Israel & rsquo ; s operation in Gaza , the war on Israel & rsquo ; s northern front rage on . death from the Israel - Hezbollah conflict be continue to rise , and over 100 , 000 Israelis be still evacuate from their home in northern Israel , lead some to question the efficacy of the UN peacekeeper force mean to maintain security in southern Lebanon . after the israeli army finish a military operation against the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) in Lebanon in 1978 , the UN establish a temporary peacekeeping force know as the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) . the body be mean to restore international peace and security and to assist Lebanon & rsquo ; s government and army in restore control of the border with Israel . Israel & rsquo ; s 1978 invasion push the PLO north of the Litani River , about 18 mile from the border , in order to limit attack against Israel . despite the establishment of UNIFIL as a peacekeeper force , Israel return to Lebanon in 1982 . in 2006 , another conflict break out between Israel and Hezbollah , a lebanese shiite group with tie to Iran . after 34 day of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 , the UN broker a cease - fire . under the agreement , UN Security Council Resolution 1701 , Israel and Hezbollah agree to cease hostility , and UNIFIL be task with ensure that no armed group other than itself and the lebanese army operate south of the Litani River . today , UNIFIL comprise more than 10 , 000 soldier from 49 nation . in addition to monitor the border , the organization also provide humanitarian assistance to civilian affect by the exchange of fire in southern Lebanon .

UNIFIL do not only monitor the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel & mdash ; at time , it find itself catch up in that contact . & nbsp ; among other incident , a car bomb kill six UNIFIL personnel in 2007 , and in October , two mortar shell of undetermined origin hit a UNIFIL base , injure one peacekeeper . & ldquo ; Hezbollah target UNIFIL because they do not want another actor in the south , & rdquo ; Ghaddar explain . & ldquo ; it be never an accident when UNIFIL personnel be target because the militant group aim to send a message both to the country that serve in these force and to the UN : do not interfere with our activity in the southern part of the country . & rdquo ; Avraham Levine , a speaker at the northern Israel - base Alma Research and Education Center , tell the Media Line that Hezbollah have more control over UNIFIL than UNIFIL do over Hezbollah . & ldquo ; there be area where UNIFIL personnel can not go to , and if they end up by mistake in Hezbollah & rsquo ; s territory , they be attack on the spot , their vehicle be burn , and sometimes they be even shoot down , & rdquo ; he say . Levine also say that Hezbollah use UNIFIL basis for its military purpose . & ldquo ; both in 2006 and in further operation that Israel carry against Hezbollah , the militant use UNIFIL compound as shield for their operation in order to stop Israel & rsquo ; s counterattack against a UN base , & rdquo ; he say . one of the rocket launch at Israel by Hezbollah in December originate just 20 yard from a UNIFIL compound . Levine say that the lebanese army & rsquo ; s lack of action to rein in Hezbollah relate to the Shia sympathy of many of the soldier as well as the interest in avoid another lebanese civil war . describe both UNIFIL and the lebanese army as ineffective deterrent to Hezbollah , he say that Israel may have to invade Lebanon once again . & ldquo ; we can not risk another Oct . 7 in the northern part of Israel since [ Hezbollah Secretary - General Hassan ] Nasrallah publicly claim his goal to invade the Galilee . even if this scenario be not pleasant for both side , we may need to stop Hezbollah by enter Lebanon as we do in the past , & rdquo ; he say . in the event that a full - scale war between Israel and Hezbollah do break out , UNIFIL may be a target , Levine say . & ldquo ; maybe this may push to reconsider its mission in the first place , & rdquo ; he speculate .",international peacekeepers day: unifil's role questioned amid israel-hezbollah conflict

Bedouin tracker , who be among the good in the country and be also serve in the IDF , if they live in illegal village may not find their home when they return from the army . their home may have be bulldoze . how do Israel expect to maintain the loyalty of its minority community , if it treat they in such an insensitive and disrespectful manner ? the BIG question on the mind of many Israelis be will Israel recover fully from October 7 ? to anyone who experience the Yom Kippur War , the answer be yes . the misery and uncertainty that now encompas the country be in a sense even more horrific then than now , because there be no mobile phone , no fax , and not every home possess a ground line telephone . the IDF death toll be 2 , 691 during a war that last for less than a month . as painful as the current IDF casualty rate be , there be far few fall soldier over a much long period , though there have be a large number of civilian casualty , particularly on October 7 itself . in the early day after the Hamas massacre , Shani Louk , a pretty 22 - year - old dual national who carry German as well as israeli citizenship , become the global symbol of Hamas tyranny and inhumanity . kidnap at the Supernova music festival by Hamas terrorist wear body cam , a video of her unconscious body on the back of a truck be circulate around the globe . her family clung to the hope that she be still alive , especially after information filter through that she be be treat in a Gaza hospital . german Ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert maintain close contact with the Louk family and help to publicize its ordeal and Germany & rsquo ; s concern . on October 30 , Shani Louk & rsquo ; s death be confirm . on Wednesday , June 19 , at 7 p . m . , her parent , Ricarda and Nissim Louk , will talk about the beloved , happy - go - lucky , music - love daughter they remember at a special evening honor Shani & rsquo ; s memory . share in that conversation , organize by Tribe Israel , will be Rabbi Shmuley Boteach . the venue be Capella , Hagag Tower , 28 Ha & rsquo ; arba Street , Tel Aviv . admission be free of charge . the event be reserve for people in Shani Louk & rsquo ; s age - group . with the ongoing transformation of the State of Israel that inter alia include change in the law , politic , the skyline , and the value we once hold dear , the question arise as to whether future change will include the establishment of a casino . the late casino mogul Sheldon Adelson want to establish a casino in Eilat so that the southern resort city would truly become the Las Vegas of the Middle East . but he be strongly oppose by a cabinet minister , the late Yosef Burg , who be afraid that a casino would become a den of vice , peddle drug and promote prostitution . Adelson & rsquo ; s vision on that score be never realize . in an interview with the writer of this column , during the period in which he be still try to convince the israeli authority , Adelson say that he have never see anyone have sex on a gambling table . since then , he marry an israeli and build casino empire in Singapore and Macao . Israelis like to gamble , and when the Hilton Taba casino open in 1994 , only 200 meter from the israeli border , gambler cross nightly from Eilat to Taba to place their bet . a lot of money that could have stay in Israel end up in Egypt . but before then and even afterward , several illegal and well - patronize casino open across Israel , but be short - live due to police raid . the only legalized gambling in Israel be the Mifal Hapayis national lottery , which have increase the variety of game and prize available to the public , and Toto sport gambling . Sheldon Adelson , who die three - and - a - half year ago , be a keen supporter of the Republican Party and one of its most generous bankroller . follow his death , his wife Dr . Miriam Adelson be a little more reserved in her donation to the party but , accord to medium report , be now throw her financial weight behind Donald Trump , who during his presidency honor she with the Presidential Medal of Freedom . recently , Miriam Adelson and her son - in - law Patrick Dumont acquire the majority share in the Dallas Mavericks in order to give the Las Vegas Sands Corporation a foothold in the Lone Star State , where they hope to introduce casino . Texas be very conservative about casino gambling , so Adelson and Dumont will have a hard row to hoe . she also pour a lot of money into the election campaign of Dade Phelan , which help he to be reelect as speaker of the Texas House of Representatives . if she succeed in open a casino in Texas , Adelson may turn her attention to Israel , where she be the publisher of the free , informative tabloid Israel Hayom . she be also a generous benefactor to various israeli cause . she and her husband give Yad Vashem its large - ever donation , and they do not skimp on other cause they support . at a time when Israel be experience an economic disaster , Adelson & rsquo ; s fiscal assistance to the nation may help to swing legislation in favor of casino . greerfc @ gmail . com","grapevine june 19, 2024: scams vs authenticity"

"in February 2005 , during the government of then - prime minister Ariel Sharon , then - defense minister Shaul Mofaz and IDF chief Moshe Ya & rsquo ; alon order a moratorium of punitive house demolition against the family of palestinian terrorist . a commission of top defense expert lead by Maj . - Gen . ( re . ) Udi Shani have empirically study whether house demolition over the last few year of the Second Intifada have increase deterrence against terrorist , conclude that the opposite be true . yet in 2023 , it seem that nearly the entire defense establishment be convince that house demolition do deter future potential terror attack . they be so sure that they even want to seal off the house of the family of the 13 - year - old Palestinian who shoot but do not kill , two israeli victim & ndash ; which would be the first time that such a measure would be take against an attempt murderer versus an actual murderer . what , if anything , change between 2005 and 2023 about Israel , the Palestinians , house demolition and deterrence ? the 2005 committee find that house demolition , rather than deter future terrorism , generally inflame hatred and increase motivation for future attack by Palestinians against Israel . accord to the defense commission , there have only be 20 case in which the threat of demolition deter potential attacker or push their family to turn they in & ndash ; out of hundred of demolition since 2001 . fundamentally , the commission report simply point out that after hundred of demolition , the Second Intifada have not be put down . furthermore , the report say that in many case house demolition hit family which , other than the one terrorist attacker , be not part of a great terror group and be view by the great palestinian public as illegitimate collective punishment . this mean that sometimes new terrorist be even be create from family or neighbor of these family who might not have become a problem . another part of the problem , the committee say , be that different palestinian group , whether the Palestinian Authority , Hamas or otherwise , frequently compensate family of terrorist and help they rebuild new home , weaken possible deterrence . in addition , if there have be some short period early in the Second Intifada when a small number of demolition might have have a deterrent effect , as the policy go on long , the deterrent effect be lose . with some very limited exception , Israel stop demolish palestinian house for punitive deterrent purpose from 2005 - 2014 & ndash ; almost a decade . it be after palestinian terrorist murder three jewish teenager that the then - government of Benjamin Netanyahu ( who go almost five year without demolition ) reinstate the demolition policy . the issue be probe again by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) during the 2015 - 2016 Knife Intifada , but this time the overwhelming majority of official find that the demolition be have a deterrent effect . significant number of Palestinians who start toward an attack , but relent , or parent who turn in their kid before they could commit an attack in process , say that save the family house have impact they greatly . some official do a victory lap on the issue in 2016 as one of the reason & ndash ; along with new technology and analysis of social medium & ndash ; that the Knife Intifada be put down before it blow up into a & ldquo ; full Intifada . & rdquo ; the Jerusalem Post recently receive additional confirmation from defense official deal with some of the great palestinian violence in the northern West Bank which conclude that demolition be still provide deterrence . they repeat the same update 2022 testimony of Palestinians ( not just rely on the 2015 - 2016 datum ) who pull back from terror at the last minute or turn in their kid to stop they from terror . one fascinating point be that some of these official do not even know that Israel & rsquo ; s moratorium on house demolition have go on for so long , nearly a decade . in fact , they be quite shocked by the notion . part of what be interesting about that be that the year 2005 - 2014 & ndash ; without house demolition & ndash ; be a much less violent time period than 2015 - 2023 have be with house demolition . of course , one counterresponse to this argument be that this be because the IDF hit palestinian terror much hard and deeply during the Second Intifada , and it be this that provide quiet . some also say that if the IDF do house demolition fast , not with week or month of delay , then there would be great deterrence . maybe , but there be no guarantee there either , and there have be case where a terrorist & rsquo ; s family have nothing to do with their activity and rush forward without figure that out would have break even israeli law as it currently exist ( keep in mind that though international law have a place for house demolition , Israel be an outlier among democracy in actually perform they ) . some other question worth askingBut it be worth ask ; when israeli defense official in 2023 say they be sure that demolition provide deterrence , be they fully and seriously consider the opposing view ? if some of they do not even recall a world without house demolition , can they be say to fully consider that view ? and if Israel have be do they more aggressively than ever since March 2022 without end the current wave of violence , what do that say ? there be no easy answer to these question . but they be question that could be crucial to ask by security professional who seriously consider both side and who ignore partisan noise for and against the demolition on either political side of the spectrum .","demolishing houses didn't stop terror in 2005, why does it work in 2023?

"israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden speak on the phone Monday for the first time in over a month as tension between the two leader continue to increase . the conversation focus on Israel & rsquo ; s war against Hamas . the campaign , which be now in its sixth month , have drive a wedge between the longtime ally that some be call unprecedented . while the relationship between the US and Israel have be dot with disagreement and crisis , the alliance have largely be consider steadfast and unwavering . tension between President Biden and Netanyahu be evident even before the war , as the israeli government seek to promote a widespread reform of the country & rsquo ; s judicial system . while Netanyahu insist that the reform would make Israel even more democratic , the US voice its concern that the overhaul would concentrate power in Israel & rsquo ; s executive branch . the White House also criticize the inclusion of several far - right ultranationalist cabinet minister in the Netanyahu government . immediate support after Oct . 7 , but be now it dwindle ? follow Hamas & rsquo ; surprise offensive against Israel , during which approximately 1 , 200 people be kill , President Biden set aside his difference with Netanyahu and move to show immediate support for the jewish state . in a visit to Tel Aviv just day after the attack , the american leader express solidarity with the israeli people and vow to continue the steady supply of arm to Israel . the US also mobilize aircraft carrier to the region to deter Israel & rsquo ; s other foe , mainly Iran , from join the war . as the war continue , the US raise more question about Israel & rsquo ; s tactic and end - game strategy . Israel & rsquo ; s offensive in Gaza have lead to high casualty , with Gaza & rsquo ; s Hamas - run Health Ministry report over 31 , 000 Palestinians kill and 73 , 000 injure . the offensive have lead to widespread destruction in the territory that will cost billion of dollar to repair . various international organization have also warn of famine in Gaza , up the pressure on Israel to halt its offensive . in the past week , the tone adopt by senior american official toward Israel & rsquo ; s leader have escalate . early this year , the american president be report to have call Netanyahu a & ldquo ; bad f * * * ing guy , & rdquo ; which he deny having say . but last week , he go on the record say the israeli leader be cause more harm than good to his country . & ldquo ; this be a unique crisis , both because it be in the midst of a war and because of what appear to be its very personal nature , & rdquo ; Dr . Shay Har - Zvi , head of the International and middle Eastern Arenas at Reichman University & rsquo ; s Institute for Policy and Strategy , tell the Media Line . & ldquo ; the personal criticism , rather than criticism of policy , make this crisis exceptional and perhaps one of the most acute . & rdquo ; the main point of contention be a pende israeli military operation in Rafah , a city in the southern Gaza Strip . accord to the United Nations , a majority of the approximately 1 . 7 million Palestinians displace by the war be take shelter in Rafah . Rafah be the only city in Gaza that have not yet see an operation of israeli ground troop . as Israel delay its operation in Rafah , international pressure against operate in the city have grow . many country be warn of an exacerbate humanitarian crisis in Rafah , prompt Israel to consider how good to handle the city & rsquo ; s civilian population . Netanyahu have vow to operate in Rafah , say that Hamas & rsquo ; senior leadership be hide there . the city be also home to an extensive underground tunnel network that be believe to cross into neighbor Egypt . the tunnel be Hamas & rsquo ; main lifeline and source of weapon , make the target a critical one in Israel & rsquo ; s mission to dismantle the terrorist organization & rsquo ; s military capability . & ldquo ; the US feel Israel be not do enough to meet the humanitarian need in Gaza and they want answer about how Israel intend to deal with the civilian presence in Rafah , & rdquo ; Har - Zvi say . & ldquo ; the humanitarian issue be at the core of the disagreement . & rdquo ; accord to a White House readout of the call between the two leader , Netanyahu agree to send a delegation to the US to & ldquo ; exchange view and discuss alternative approach that would target key element of Hamas and secure the Egypt - Gaza border without a major ground operation in Rafah . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; the american perception be that because of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s political consideration , he be reject any possible solution , & rdquo ; Har - Zvi add . & ldquo ; he be not only miss what could be a historic opportunity , but also strategically entangle Israel by increase the risk of a wide conflict and this will directly hurt american strategic interest . & rdquo ; tension on Israel & rsquo ; s northern border have also escalate , threaten to widen the scope of the conflict . these development have the White House increasingly on edge . negotiation for a truce and a deal that would see the israeli hostage be hold by Hamas release could have a calming effect on the region . those talk be currently underway in Qatar . & ldquo ; the US government be concern that the failure of these talk will mean a regional escalation , & rdquo ; Har - Zvi say . & ldquo ; there be an understanding within the administration that the region be now at a critical crossroad . & rdquo ; during last month & rsquo ; s democratic primary in Michigan , in which the incumbent president be run uncontested , 13 % of voter vote & ldquo ; uncommitted & rdquo ; as part of a movement to protest his handling of the Israel - Gaza war . that result signal to the White House that its Gaza policy be put the president at risk . & ldquo ; in the beginning of the war , Biden be willing to pay the price for his support for Israel , but now the uncommitted vote appear to be gain momentum and will likely influence Biden , & rdquo ; Har - Zvi explain . over the weekend , Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer sharply criticize Netanyahu and call for early election in Israel . Schumer be criticize both by Israelis and by US Republicans for interfere in internal israeli affair . the president praise the majority leader & rsquo ; s speech , far upset Netanyahu . although the current tension between Israel and the US have be call unprecedented , the two country have face rocky period before . & ldquo ; there be a tendency to see crisis as & lsquo ; the bad & rsquo ; in the heat of the moment , & rdquo ; Zalman Shoval , a former israeli ambassador to the US , tell the Media Line . he say there have be & ldquo ; far bad & rdquo ; crisis than what Israel and the US be currently face . in the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War , Israel and the US face disagreement about how to prevent future conflict between Israel and Egypt . as a result of the disagreement , the US & ldquo ; reassessed & rdquo ; its relation with Israel and freeze arm delivery to the country , lead to great tension between the ally . Israel later go on to sign a disengagement agreement with Egypt , likely due to american pressure . in the early 1990 , President George H . w . Bush announce that the US would withhold loan guarantee to Israel until it stop build settlement in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . both crisis appear unprecedented and , to some , insurmountable . israeli and american society have both change significantly since the time of those crisis . the israeli public have increasingly shift to the right , with consistently less support for a negotiate solution that would see the establishment of a palestinian state . the Democratic Party have also change in recent year , with a grow progressive element that show more support for the Palestinians . & ldquo ; these change must not be underestimate , & rdquo ; Shoval say . & ldquo ; the political future of both country be unclear . & rdquo ; this future depend very much on the fate of the american and israeli leader . President Biden be in the midst of an election campaign set to culminate in November 2024 .

Friedman describe in the book & ndash ; set to be release on February 9 & ndash ; how he and Trump & rsquo ; s Middle East envoy at the time , Jason Greenblatt , tip off Netanyahu and work together to disabuse Trump of that notion . the ambassador describe a & ldquo ; brilliant move & rdquo ; by the Palestinians ahead of Trump & rsquo ; s visit to the region in May 2017 , in which they have & ldquo ; a respected businessman , major philanthropist and active player in the region , & rdquo ; and a Trump supporter , speak to the president on the topic . that person be Ron Lauder , who once support Netanyahu but have a fall out with he , though Friedman do not name he in the book . Lauder tell Trump that the Palestinians & ldquo ; be prepared to make peace with Israel on very favorable term , even to include concede all of Jerusalem to israeli sovereignty and give up the return of refugee , but the problem be that Bibi Netanyahu be unwilling to negotiate peace . the surrogate inform the president that he need to pressure Netanyahu and embrace Abbas in order to make a deal . Trump buy it . . . he be go to put the screw to Netanyahu to force a deal . & rdquo ; know that Abbas would never consider such a deal that Lauder claim , Greenblatt call Friedman , and they agree that Netanyahu should be warn that the Palestinians have manipulate Trump . Netanyahu be & ldquo ; very agitated & rdquo ; by the call , and call Friedman for a meeting . the ambassador suggest that the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office prepare a video that would reveal Abbas & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; true color . & rdquo ; contrary to what journalist Bob Woodward report in his book Rage & ndash ; that Netanyahu show Trump a doctor video & ndash ; Friedman write : & ldquo ; I emphasize that this need to be completely honest & ndash ; nothing out of context and nothing subject to multiple interpretation . & rdquo ; in Trump & rsquo ; s first meeting in Israel with then - president Reuven Rivlin , he say , & ldquo ; he understand that Abbas be desperate to do a peace deal , the prime minister of Israel be unwilling . & rdquo ; Friedman , Greenblatt and the other be worried that Trump & rsquo ; s remark would be leak to the press & ndash ; perhaps in light of Rivlin & rsquo ; s contentious relationship with Netanyahu & ndash ; but they be not .

"Hezbollah be currently engage in a war of attrition on the israeli border , but it be not unlikely that they will receive order from Tehran to redirect force to another area they recently fight in & ndash ; northern Syria . in the past week , a wave of protest begin in every district of the rebel - hold Idlib province in northwestern Syria . this be the last stronghold of the syrian opposition and the last remnant of the civil war in Syria from a decade ago , a war that end in other area of the country in 2018 . Syria 's Idlib district be not ready to surrenderat the height of the civil war in Syria in 2015 , opposition force , lead by Jabhat al - Nusra , a jihadist faction of al - Qaeda in Syria , united . the coalition of islamist organization push the syrian army out of the Idlib district and have hold most of it to this day . this be a district that the syrian regime can not afford to ignore due to its strategic location . Idlib be very close to Latakia & ndash ; the stronghold of Syria 's rule Alawite community , as well as to russian military basis in Syria & ndash ; the Russian - operate air force base in Hmeimim and the naval port in Tartus . despite the relentless syrian air force bombing on the Idlib district ( include even to the present day ) , the opposition maintain control of the area with impressive tenacity . it seem that in recent year , even Assad 's supporter have give up hope of seize control of Idlib . shi'ite militia have deplete their force in Syria , and most of Hezbollah 's man have return to Lebanon . the Russians ' attention be elsewhere too , as they be deeply involved in the war in Ukraine . Bashar Assad 's army be not capable of effectively fighting , due to the significant wear and tear it have endure . the economy of Syria be shatter , unemployment be rampant , and the currency continue to lose its value . there be no money to sustain the army or rebuild it significantly . however , this do not stop Assad 's army from continue to bomb the civilian of Idlib indiscriminately . the regime 's message be clear : life in the "" liberated "" territory will remain a hell until they return to Assad 's rule . the ruler of Idlib be try to gain local legitimacy . they change the name of their organization from Jabhat al - Nusra to "" Hay'at Tahrir al - Sham "" ( Organization for the Liberation of the Levant or HTS ) and seemingly distance themselves from al - Qaeda , but they remain a jihadist fundamentalist group . the area under the organization 's control essentially be islamic emirate with strict religious law . the region do receive support from Turkey , mainly feel in civilian area , especially regard food . however , turkish aid be limit as Turkey itself be experience a complex economic crisis . overall , the Idlib province suffer from severe poverty and unemployment . Israel be also involve without even know itboth side , the syrian regime and the opposition in Idlib , accuse each other of receive israeli support . the opposition constantly compare Assad 's bombing on school and hospital to the current situation in Gaza : to they , Assad and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be two similar enemy . the only place in Syria where demonstration in support of Gaza have take place since October 7 be in Idlib province . by contrast , the syrian regime accuse the opposition of seek help from Israel , as the israeli Air Force often bomb Assad 's supporter in Syria & ndash ; mainly shi'ite terrorist group such as Hezbollah . it seem that in the Middle East , the enemy of your enemy can still be your enemy . opportunity for the syrian regimelast week , protest begin in various area of Idlib province against the rule of HTS and specifically against the leader of the organization , Abu Mohammad al - Julani . Al Jazeera recently cover the development in the province with concern . accord to Al Jazeera , which be know for its support of islamic organization , the protest arise due to two issue : political and economic & ndash ; the authoritarian rule of the provincial leader , accusation of corruption , and the severe economic crisis . Julani 's organization recently carry out a wave of arrest of around a thousand activist from various opposition organization in the province , include activist who have previously belong to his organization . the release detainee report severe torture of prisoner who be arrest on suspicion of collaborate with the Assad regime . analyst attribute the deteriorate situation to the lack of a political solution and a significant reduction in international aid to the province in recent month . this crisis be create due to the uncompromising and unyielde stance of the zealous jihadist ruler Julani , who be not willing to make any political concession . the current wave of protest openly call for the overthrow of Julani 's oppressive rule , which some compare to the repression of the Assad regime . the protester claim that the current situation be even bad than during Assad 's rule because it also include religious repression in the style of ISIS . the protester demand the establishment of a local council to run the province . HTS be now try to calm the protest by release more prisoner , monitor price increase , and ease some taxis . however , it seem that the protest have spiral out of control and be only gain momentum . interpreter from the Lebanese Al - Mayadeen outlet reveal that behind the protest stand Turkey , which aim to undermine the control of Idlib from the hand of Julani and return it to the Free syrian Army under Ankara 's direct control . the recent development undoubtedly weaken Julani , who still control about 75 % of Idlib . this mark the breakdown of the coalition after many year of unity . an opportunity for Assad , a problem for HezbollahThe division , anarchy , and turmoil in the Idlib region undoubtedly present a golden opportunity for control in Damascus , which may not return . now Assad 's army could potentially enter the region with significant support to restore it to the embrace of the regime , after almost a decade of neglect . however , this would require substantial support force . for the occupation of Idlib , a significant asset for the Assad regime in particular , and the "" resistance axis "" in general , Iran would need to send substantial force . these force mainly include Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Unit militia from Iraq and Hezbollah force from Lebanon . however , Hezbollah can not afford a two - front war . now , Iran 's axis of resistance , the syrian regime , and Shi'ite militia face a crossroad : whether to continue the war in the israeli arena or redirect force to northern Syria ? in the case of the Israel front , it be a purposeless war with Hezbollah already suffer over 230 casualty and no achievement against the highly motivated and prepare IDF . in the case of Idlib , however , it present an opportunity for a significant strategic victory against the disintegrate opposition . will the syrian arena affect our northern border ? will Hezbollah agree to a compromise on our border in order to turn its attention to Syria ? only time will tell .

"the six small stand - up box contain three - dimensional doll in Inca costume , complete with their traditional design and surround by ceramic pot , also in the traditional style . highly colorful , these miniature doll be amazingly make out of potato flour ! peruvian artist Zuly Jimenez have be ask by Jerusalem - base artist David Moss to illustrate the Purim story as tell in the Scroll of Esther as if it be set in the artist & rsquo ; s own surrounding . Jimenez decide to root her interpretation in Peru & rsquo ; s ancient culture , which mean go back to a time when the Incas rule the land . one innovation among many be the depiction of Haman lead Mordechai sit on a llama , since , as she explain , the horse have not be introduce into this part of the world until the Spaniards come and conquer Peru . the experience of make these model be for Jimenez & ldquo ; unforgettable & rdquo ; in that it combine art and history , legend and story - telling . it be precisely the reaction that Moss be look for and have already receive from his many guest artist from around the world over the previous thirty year when he start this unique project . & ldquo ; in 1990 , I be in Bali , Indonesia , & rdquo ; he recall , & ldquo ; search for craftspeople for another project of mine , when I view the beautiful miniature be produce by the local artist . Bali , a traditional Hindu society , be full of palace , royalty , prince and princess , ceremony and ritual . all these thing strongly remind I of the story of Esther and Purim . so when I go back the second time , I ask artist from two different village to do their take on the story . I give they parchment and the story of Esther translate into Indonesian . I draw six small blank rectangle and I tell they to imagine that this story be happen right in their village . the six scene I ask they to envisage include Achashverus & rsquo ; s party at the beginning of the story ; the beauty contest in which Esther participate and win ; the reach out of the scepter by the king to Esther ; Haman lead Mordechai on the king & rsquo ; s horse ; the hanging of Haman & rsquo ; s ten son ; and the writing out of the megilla to go out to all the land of the king & rsquo ; s massive kingdom . I didn & rsquo ; t want they to imagine Persia or anything to do with the original story . it have to be local in their own culture and style . I wait for the response . when I view the stunningly original craft image they have produce , it give I another thought : perhaps I could expand this idea by seek out folk artist from around the world willing to depict these same six scene in their own vernacular culture and style . thus begin a fascinating , bizarre thirty - year quest I & rsquo ; ve come to call Esther without Borders , & rdquo ; say Moss . esther without BordersAlthough it be initially happenstance that energize the beginning of the project , Moss & rsquo ; s enthusiasm only grow as he encounter folk artist from around the world who respond positively to his strange request . in the course of his ongoing project , he encounter artist from Ukraine , Russia , Bali , India , Italy , Ecuador , Colombia , Panama , California , New Mexico , and so on , thus echo the megilla & rsquo ; s Achashveros , whose kingdom spread from & ldquo ; hodu to Kush & rdquo ; ( India to Ethiopia ) . the original Purim have a profoundly universal flavor . & ldquo ; I initially seek out folk artist , & rdquo ; say Moss , & ldquo ; although I & rsquo ; ve ask a few professional artist , too . another change come about when I approach an artist in Italy whose charming work I have spot in a small exhibition in the Piedmont region . he say he & rsquo ; d love to do the project but that he could not work in the miniature format I have be request . I tell he to use whatever format he like . he be very imaginative , create a delightful accordion book , and also draw the main character from the story on the back of the work . he have a great sense of humor , depict the eunuch of the king , for example , with a pair of scissor on his turban ! & nbsp ; & ldquo ; once the mold be break , I let the rest of the artist do the image in whatever format they be most comfortable with . this come to mean the project have be do on tile , fabric , icon , and envelope , as well as on paper and parchment . & rdquo ; although Moss be a much travel artist , the language of communication with the artist do sometimes present problem . & ldquo ; with the italian artist , I find a nearby gallery owner who help locate and communicate with the artist . I use Google Translate to communicate with many of the artist . fortunately , the Book of Esther be also in the Christian Bible , which have be translate into hundred of language . I send the artist the entire book in their own language and highlight the six verse , & rdquo ; he explain . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; a friend be head off to Australia , and I ask she to propose the project to an aboriginal artist if she come across one . she find Emma Burchill , a wonderful artist who do the project in their highly abstract , symbolic style . she explain to I how the Aborigines paint their work use dot as if they be look down at the scene from a bird & rsquo ; s eye view . therefore , she show the feast view from above as their campfire , with the guest dance the traditional corrobbree ceremony around the fire . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; he do not have to travel for every artist . some come to he in his studio in Huzot Hayotzer beneath the wall of the Old City of Jerusalem . Moss meet Boris Gozzo , a talented ukrainian artist live in Israel whose illustration portray some of the man in the scene as drunken peasant . Most year , the art studio in Huzot Hayotzer play host to an international art and craft fair , so it be that Moss meet Rajendra Kumar Moktan from Nepal whose expertise be in the creation of mandelas & ndash ; prayer wheel use in Buddhist and Hindu sacred rite and as an instrument of meditation . the detailed scene he paint on canvas truly convey the ceremony of nepalese culture . & nbsp ; when I meet Moss in his somewhat overcrowded studio , he have just get off the phone with a woman from Portugal . & ldquo ; her name be Teresa , & rdquo ; he say . & ldquo ; she work on Azulejo tile in the blue and white ceramic tradition from the 17th and 18th century . they be influence by Delft tile . she have just send I a sketch of what she be do and write to I that she be finish the last tile . she have paint the station of the cross in ceramic for her local cathedral and the tile for the Esther story be do in this strong portuguese , christian tradition . & rdquo ; not that every encounter be successful . & ldquo ; I try a chinese artist but didn & rsquo ; t like what he do . I & rsquo ; ll have to go back there and try someone else . also , although I pay the artist whatever fee they request , if they ask more than I can afford , I let it go , & rdquo ; he say . it be perhaps not surprising that some of these artist become firm friend . & ldquo ; in Morro Bay , California , I meet Philip Carey , who specialize in draw delightful miniature scene on envelope and mail they to their destination via the post office . they be whimsical and full of humor . I marvel how he translate the Esther story into his envelope art . he portray each of the figure as be from the animal world . so his king be a Monarch butterfly , Esther be a Morro Bay sea otter , Mordechai a bald eagle ride on a sea horse , Haman be depict as a coyote , and so forth . Esther send out the Purim story by & lsquo ; seamail & rsquo ; on seahorse , and & lsquo ; landmail & rsquo ; with roadrunner . Philip execute all these envelope image in ink and colored pencil and then send they to I through the post office . we be in close contact over the year , but tragically he have pass away . I treasure these miniature masterpiece that so embody who he be . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; although Moss be happy to give many of these artist some visibility , he come upon one group of unknown artist who have simply disappear . these be the Mimbres , an extinct civilization from southern New Mexico who flourish between 1 , 000 and 1 , 150 CE and then vanish , leave behind no writing . all that remain of they be the ruin of their building and their black - and - white pottery with unique stylize design . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I be always captivate by the powerful design they leave behind , and feel that it be somehow unfair that I be limit my project to living culture . I decide to imagine myself as an ancient Mimbres artist and design the six Esther scene as round , bowl - like image base on what be recover from their tradition , & rdquo ; he say . & nbsp ; Moss , an internationally recognize book artist , calligrapher , designer of ketubot and architectural design , appreciate how he have succeed sufficiently well to have the ability and willingness to help fellow artist who be not so fortunate . at the same time , he have not rush this project nor do he have future plan for it . & ldquo ; I love that there be no end , goal , or deadline to this , & rdquo ; he confess . & ldquo ; People have suggest that I turn it into a book , other that it should be exhibit . my daughter Elyssa run a center opposite my studio call Kol HaOt , which bring together art and Judaism . we do do a small show of these work there . but the beauty of this project for I be in the remarkable people it have connect I with , the thrill and surprise of open each new contribution , and the sheer joy of watch a simple idea unfold and blossom in so many surprising way . & rdquo ; whichever way Moss decide , it would indeed be a pity if this impressive project be not view by a much large audience . but maybe , as he joke , he & rsquo ; s go to wait until he reach 127 nation & ndash ; from India to Ethiopia and beyond ! ■",david moss's purim project: esther without borders

ON MAY 15 , 1948 , the orchestra become the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ( IPO ) , and its relationship with the people of Israel have a deserve place in the reflection about nationhood , identity , and independence that mark Independence Day . as the National Council and the guest make their way to the ground floor area , the orchestra assemble in the museum 's upper gallery . at exactly 4 p . m . , Ben - Gurion rap his gavel . this be the prearrange signal for the orchestra to strike up "" Hatikvah . "" unfortunately , someone miss the cue , and from above come only silence . never one to lack initiative , Ben - Gurion promptly launch his uncertain voice into the anthem ; rather raggedly , the other member of the People 's Council join in . but someone in the hall do respond to that gavel – a young radio engineer , Ralf Hellinger , who have be run the underground radio station of the Hagana , the clandestine jewish self - defense force . tip off by american journalist about what be to take place , Hellinger have arrive at the Tel Aviv museum that afternoon cart two of his cumbersome 78 rpm recording machine . after proclaim the new State , Ben - Gurion invite the member of the People 's Council , one by one , to sign the document . as the last one put his name on the scroll , to thunderous applause , the orchestra finally make its presence know , and bring the proceeding to a close with "" Hatikvah .

Paltrow have make several previous film , include the excellent 2007 the Good Night , about a man who want to achieve in his dream what he couldn & rsquo ; t accomplish while awake , star Gwyneth Paltrow , Penelope Cruz , Danny DeVito , and Martin Freeman . Paltrow , whose late father , the director , Bruce Paltrow , be jewish , become interested in the story surround the Eichmann trial , especially concern the fate of Eichmann & rsquo ; s body , and begin research they in detail . decide that for the sake of authenticity , any movie about this topic would have to be in Hebrew and need a screenwriter who be an israeli native , he bring on director Tom Shoval , who make the movie Youth and shake your care away , to collaborate with he on the screenplay . June Zero present three story that be connect thematically and create a vivid portrait of the diversity of life in Israel in the early & rsquo ; 60 . we know that Eichmann , the notorious Nazi commander who be responsible for implement the Final Solution and cause the death of million of Jews , be hang outside a Ramla prison on June 1 , 1962 . & nbsp ; however , people forget that he spend about two year in Israel , as investigator interrogate he before the trial , during his trial , and in the period of appeal that follow the trial . there be a great fear on the part of the government & ndash ; a justified fear & ndash ; that a concentration camp survivor might assassinate he as revenge for the murder of their family . since the vast majority of holocaust victim be Ashkenazim , only mizrahi police be allow to guard Eichmann , and the movie focus on Haim ( Yoav Levi ) , his Moroccan - bear main guard . & nbsp ; we hear Eichmann speak and see his foot and other part of his body & ndash ; such as his neck , in a harrowing scene when he be get his hair cut and Haim worry that the barber will try to slit his throat & ndash ; but he be not a character in the film . instead , we identify with Haim who faithfully carry out the bizarre task of ensure that no harm come to one of the most notorious war criminal in history . other story portray in the filmanother STORY feature David ( Noam Ovadia ) , a mischievous 13 - year - old immigrant from Libya , who have be send to work part - time in a factory run by a gruff owner ( Tzahi Grad ) . this factory be give the assignment to build an oven for cremation , a method of body disposal not use in Israel since both jewish and muslim religious law prohibit its use . the idea be to cremate Eichmann & rsquo ; s body and scatter the ashe outside Israel & rsquo ; s territorial water , so there would be no grave that could become a spot where pro - Nazis could make pilgrimage to . for the factory and its staff , it be a race against time to create this oven that be unlike anything they have ever make before , and they be aid by David & rsquo ; s boldness and by the thoroughness of a survivor ( Ami Smolarchik ) , who struggle with his memory . the third section be set in Poland , as Micha ( Tom Hagy ) , a young Holocaust survivor investigate Eichmann & rsquo ; s crime , revisit the ghetto and other site where he and his family suffer and tell his story to visitor from abroad . there he meet a representative ( Joy Rieger ) of an israeli delegation and the two engage in debate over how good to commemorate the Holocaust . she be critical of dwell too long on the detail of what happen , while he feel it be his mission to tell his story to the world , and for all survivor to tell their story . in a statement release by the producer , Paltrow , who visit Israel many time to research the movie , say that he feel that it be urgent to tell story from the Holocaust to a young generation around the world who may not understand what really happen and that he want to tell story people have not hear before . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; what distinguish this film from other Holocaust film be the examination of the subject through the most obvious physical and political consequence of the Holocaust : the State of Israel .

Tom Shoval speak warmly and appreciatively about collaborate with Paltrow on the screenplay . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Jake get interested in everything connect to the Eichmann trial , it be a way for he to connect to his jewish root and identity , it & rsquo ; s something he & rsquo ; s speak about a lot . & rdquo ; Paltrow become very interested in Israel in the early & rsquo ; 60 , Shoval say , and after he read an article about the building of the oven , he know it would be the centerpiece of the film . PALTROW be visit Israel to work on pre - production for the film when the covid pandemic break out , and he be stick in Israel for a few week . he and Shoval use the time to fine - tune the script . Paltrow even file paperwork to emigrate to Israel so that he could stay in the country to keep work . & ldquo ; it be a long journey , fill with unexpected turn , & rdquo ; say Shoval . at first , they have plan the movie to be mainly about the building of the oven , but then they realize it need to be a & ldquo ; panorama of israeli story of this period . this interest we and we find so many fascinating story , we know we need to include they . & rdquo ; the decision to move outside of Israel and back to Poland to tell Micha & rsquo ; s story be also important in their writing process . & ldquo ; the movie be about memory and history , about what it be to bear witness to the past . . . before the Eichmann trial , it wasn & rsquo ; t acceptable for holocaust survivor to tell their story in public in Israel . . . and it be at this moment when the survivor receive a kind of validation of their experience . it be a turning point and we want to show a character who experience this as part of the film . & rdquo ; the wealth of story they discover & ldquo ; make it possible for we to present a varied wide - range portrait of Israel , to show the Ashkenazim and the Mizrahim , the secular and religious , the Jews and the Arabs , the survivor and those who weren & rsquo ; t in the Holocaust , and how it all come together in this story . . . & rdquo ; say Shoval . & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s a story that hasn & rsquo ; t be tell before , and it be important to we to tell it . & rdquo ;",'june zero': an obscure story about eichmann in israel after the trial

"& nbsp ; Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas tell US and European Union official this week that he be ready to return to the negotiating table with Israel under the umbrella of the Quartet , which , in addition to the Americans and Europeans , also consist of Russia and the United Nations . & nbsp ; on Wednesday , Abbas repeat his readiness to resume the stall peace process with Israel during a speech before the Arab Parliament , the legislative body of the Arab League . & nbsp ; Abbas & rsquo ; s talk about revive the peace process come amid the war that erupt last week between Israel and Hamas . Abbas & rsquo ; s remark come in the context of his effort to show the Americans and Europeans that he be as relevant as ever and that they should look forward to work with he , especially regard any future peace process with Israel . & nbsp ; Abbas , in other word , be send a message to everyone , include the Palestinians and Arabs , that he remain the one and only address for any arrangement or agreement concern the Palestinians and the conflict with Israel . he feel the need to send this message as his rival in Hamas be negotiate with UN , egyptian , Qatari , turkish and other official around the world way of reach a ceasefire with Israel . & nbsp ; the 85 - year - OLD Abbas have always be know as someone who like to be the center of attention . he enjoy make a drama out of anything that upset he . he also seem to relish the thought of keep everyone in suspense regard his future move , just as he do when he announce & ndash ; and later delay & ndash ; the palestinian parliamentary and presidential election , which be suppose to take place on May 22 and July 31 , respectively . & nbsp ; Abbas & rsquo ; s decision in late April to postpone the election put the spotlight on he again , even though he receive a lot of negative coverage in the arab and western medium for use Jerusalem as a pretext to call off the vote . but in this case , Abbas seem to be go along with the famous quote : & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t care what the newspaper say about I as long as they spell my name right . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas , however , do not foresee the consequence of his decision to delay the election and blame Israel for hinder the vote . his accusation against Israel , particularly surround the controversy over the participation of Jerusalem & rsquo ; s arab resident in the palestinian election , be see by palestinian political analyst as one of the factor that contribute to the eruption of violence in the city . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the president do not expect that his statement would add fuel to the fire , & rdquo ; say political analyst Ghassan Abu Omar . & ldquo ; worse , he do not expect the demonstration , which begin in Jerusalem and later spread to the West Bank , to turn into pro - Hamas rally . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; indeed , Hamas be successful in its effort to take advantage of the violence on the street of Jerusalem to far bolster its standing among the palestinian public . Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip be rub their hand with glee as they watch thousand of Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank raise Hamas flag and chant : & ldquo ; we be all the man of [ Hamas military wing commander ] Mohammed Deif ! & rdquo ; & nbsp ; buoy by these scene , Hamas decide to take the risk of fire rocket at Jerusalem during the Jerusalem Day celebration as part of the Gaza - base terrorist group & rsquo ; s effort to present itself as the & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of the city and al - Aqsa Mosque . apparently , Hamas be expect a limited response from Israel , one that would perhaps lead to only a few hour of fighting . & nbsp ; the rocket that Hamas launch at Jerusalem be direct not only against Israel , but against Abbas , too . the rocket be mean to show the palestinian public , as well as all Arabs and Muslims , that while Hamas be prepared to attack Israel to & ldquo ; deter & rdquo ; it from evict arab family from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah , Abbas be do nothing to stop the Israeli & ldquo ; aggression . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the Hamas attack on Israel make Abbas look very bad , & rdquo ; remark a veteran palestinian journalist from Nablus . & ldquo ; in the eye of the palestinian people , Hamas become the hero , while Abbas be continue to conduct security coordination with Israel , make he appear as a traitor . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; to avoid a damaging loss of face , Abbas and his rule Fatah faction leader join call for a & ldquo ; day of rage & rdquo ; early this week in protest of Israel & rsquo ; s military strike on the Gaza Strip . senior Fatah leader such as Mahmoud al - Aloul be even send to participate in demonstration against Israel in some part of the West Bank . Fatah activist in Ramallah and other palestinian city try to turn the protest into pro - abbas rally , but to no avail . & nbsp ; moreover , mask gunman belong to Fatah & rsquo ; s military wing , al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , appear on the street of some palestinian city in the West Bank to issue threat against Israel . this move be part of a desperate effort by the Fatah leadership to counter the numerous appearance of mask commander and spokesman of Hamas and palestinian Islamic Jihad during the past week . it be Fatah & rsquo ; s way of tell the palestinian public that the faction have not abandon the armed struggle against Israel . & nbsp ; in his speech before the Arab Parliament on Wednesday , Abbas say that he be still work to set a new date for the parliamentary and presidential election . he be also report to have relay the same message to US envoy Hady Amr and EU official with whom he meet during the past week . & nbsp ; if true , this message prove that Abbas have completely lose touch with reality . any election that be hold under the current circumstance would be disastrous for Abbas & rsquo ; s Fatah , give Hamas & rsquo ; s rise popularity among the Palestinians in the aftermath of the late round of fight with Israel . & nbsp ; Hamas leader be already claim & ldquo ; victory & rdquo ; for fire thousand of rocket and missile into Israel and force million of Israelis into bomb shelter . & nbsp ; they be also take credit for damaging relation between Jews and Arabs inside Israel and allegedly force Israel to & ldquo ; scale down & rdquo ; its measure in Jerusalem , include the suspension of visit by Jews to the Temple Mount , the removal of security barrier at the Old City & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate and the postponement of a court decision to evict the arab family from their home in Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; these & ldquo ; achievement & rdquo ; will be add to the fact that , as in previous round of hostility , the late fighting do not end Hamas & rsquo ; s rule over the Gaza Strip . Hamas may have suffer severe blow due to the loss of some of its senior military commander and the massive destruction of its military facility and terrorist infrastructure , but as long as it retain its control over the Gaza Strip , that & rsquo ; s see by its leader and many Palestinians as a & ldquo ; victory . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; this , in addition to the fact that Hamas once again succeed in prove that despite the continued israeli and egyptian blockade on the Gaza Strip , it have manage to amass large amount of rocket and missile . & nbsp ; needless to say , any & ldquo ; victory & rdquo ; for Hamas be bad news for Abbas and Fatah . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; first , Abbas lose much credibility when he delay the election , & rdquo ; explain palestinian academic Marwan Abu Sbeih . & ldquo ; the Gaza war drive the final nail in his coffin . no one seem to take he seriously , not even the arab leader . not a single arab head of state call President Abbas during the war to talk about the situation . the only people who be talk to he be the Americans and Europeans , who still believe that he be relevant . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; in the come day and week , Abbas be likely to increase his effort to return to center stage in order to show his people and the rest of the world that he remain a major player in the palestinian arena . but the event of the past few month have show that he have even lose control over his own Fatah faction , which be plan to run in the parliamentary election on three separate list . the split in Fatah and the fear of a Hamas electoral victory be believe to be the main reason behind Abbas & rsquo ; s decision to delay the vote . & nbsp ; even if the US and the EU manage to revive the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel , it & rsquo ; s hard to see how Abbas would be able to return to the negotiating table amid the fragmentation in Fatah and the soar popularity of Hamas . as a former Fatah official in Ramallah comment this week , & ldquo ; if the Palestinians and Arabs no long take this man seriously , why should anyone else , include the Israelis , Americans and Europeans , take he seriously ? & nbsp ; & ldquo ; this man [ Abbas ] have divide Fatah , alienate many Palestinians and consolidate the division between the West Bank and Gaza Strip . the Palestinians need new face , new leader . & rdquo ;",abbas struggles to stay relevant in the israel-palestinian conflict

"on US President Joe Biden & rsquo ; s flight to Tel Aviv on Wednesday , National Security spokesperson John Kirby say Biden would be ask Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & ldquo ; some tough question . & rdquo ; among those tough question be certainly one about what Israel would do to prevent as many civilian casualty as possible inside Gaza , what Israel would do to prevent a humanitarian crisis , and how Jerusalem plan to respond to Hezbollah provocation in the north . and one of those tough question be surely a simple one : what be the endgame ? what be Israel & rsquo ; s plan and vision for the Gaza Strip the day after ? Israel clearly state the goal of this war : to destroy Hamas and remove its control over Gaza . but what happen the day after ? then what ? amid the horror , shock , and fury that have grip this country since October 7 , there have be little public discussion inside Israel of this issue and the future of the Gaza Strip . from an israeli point of view , this be entirely understandable . with the blood still boil from the horrific Simchat Torah massacre , the country & rsquo ; s focus be simply on uproot Hamas , on deliver the terrorist organization a mortal blow . & nbsp ; everything else can wait , include apportion blame and responsibility for the catastrophe and think about what come next . but for Washington , a & ldquo ; we - will - deal - with - this - later & rdquo ; attitude be not enough , and for Biden to be able to sell continued support for Israel to his party and his country , he obviously want to know what policy he be support and what Israel want to do after Hamas be expel . Hamas : short - term vs long - term goalsdelivere a devastating blow to Hamas and remove they from power in Gaza be short - term goal . but what be the long - term goal ? this be important to define because some will only support short - term goal if they know the long - term plan . and this place Israel in a dilemma because it have never articulate any long - term plan for Gaza . before October 7 , Israel & rsquo ; s policy toward Gaza could be sum up as contain terrorism until Hamas either realize that it be not in their interest to pursue terror or something big happen and it be drive from power . well , now something big have happen , and Israel be determined to drive Hamas from power . Biden come here partly to hear from Israel what come next . on the face of it , the option be rather limited . the first option be that Israel re - occupy Gaza - - either the whole area or part of it - - and remain there indefinitely . the logic behind this be that the only way to ensure that , once kick out , Hamas do not return be for Israel to be in control . while two week ago this idea would have be dismiss as the ranting of the far - right , the Simchat Torah atrocity have bring discussion of that into the mainstream . even though President Isaac Herzog have say publicly that Israel have no intention of do this , the idea be out there . in a 60 - minute interview on Sunday , Biden relate to this and say that , in his estimation , such a move would be a & ldquo ; big mistake . & rdquo ; he certainly make that position clear in his meeting here on Wednesday . after dismantle Hamas , a second option be for Israel to hand control of it and its more than two million resident to the Palestinian Authority . the problem with this option be that the Palestinian Authority , both weak and highly unpopular among Palestinians , can barely control the area in the West Bank currently under its control , let alone take on a much big project . & nbsp ; in this scenario , hand Gaza over to the PA , which the Palestinian Authority lose control of in 2007 in a bloody coup , would likely necessitate Israel retain the right to enter the Gaza Strip , as it do currently in palestinian town in the West Bank , for security reason . a third option would be for Egypt to take control of the area , something egyptian President Abdel Fattah al - Sisi have make abundantly clear he have no interest in do . and another option would be for Gaza to come under the administration of some kind of international consortium , perhaps an international peacekeeping team or a group of state from the Organization of Islamic Conference . this option , too , be consider unrealistic . first , few country be bite at the bit to take on this chore . second , Israel & rsquo ; s experience with international peacekeeper keep terrorist group out of territory have not be good , as evidence by the situation in southern Lebanon , where peacekeeper have be unable to keep Hezbollah from take control and threaten Israel . in addition , invite international actor into an area where Israel might continuously need to engage militarily be only invite trouble . since none of those possibility be particularly attractive , develop other , perhaps more creative idea be need to present as an endgame . have an endgame be essential not only to answer Biden & rsquo ; s question but also for other reason , include to help Israel & rsquo ; s public diplomacy effort as the war grind on and the focus , as be already the case , move from the October 7 massacre to the devastation in Gaza . israeli spokespeople interview about the situation have so far be able to deflect question about an endgame by say & ldquo ; first thing first , & rdquo ; first let the country defeat Hamas , and then Israel will deal with the future of Gaza . & nbsp ; but the country & rsquo ; s public diplomacy effort would be help if the spokespeople say , & ldquo ; we be destroy Hamas today , and this be what we want to see happen tomorrow . & rdquo ; in the need for an endgame , Israel should learn from the experience of the 1967 six - Day War . Israel win that war , but never succeed in clearly define what it hope to see down the line . it never define clearly , and still have not define clearly , what its endgame be for Judea and Samaria . and it suffer from that lack of clarity . as the Palestinians demand a complete return to the 1967 line , Israel always say what it want depend on what the Arabs say , what the Americans want , and what the Palestinians would agree to . but Israel never state clearly what it want to do with the territory . it always depend , but depend be not policy . one can not achieve what one do not define . Israel already need to define what it want to see happen in Gaza when the war end and Hamas be destroy . only then , maybe , will this be achievable .",israel already needs a plan for the day after it topples hamas - analysis

I see with complete clarity the heinousness and horrific nature of the event . & rdquo ; Elya CowlandRabbi Yehoshua Pfeffer of Ramot also speak about the attack as he be head to the shiva for the victim , point out two way to view the situation . & ldquo ; on the one hand , this be a human tragedy & ndash ; and that be perhaps the first reaction , especially with this so close to home . these be bus stop where all our kid be , so you feel a certain sense of insecurity ; you don & rsquo ; t know who be go to be next . the result be a more tense atmosphere . & ldquo ; the religious response be to turn to God in prayer and strengthen element of practice . but there be also the political aspect . for example , people such as [ National Security Minister Itamar ] Ben - Gvir have promise to restore security in face of attack and threat . & ldquo ; he be always first at the scene and garner support from even haredim and the youth . and yet , have he do anything ? be it all talk or will he actually do something that will give we a great sense of security ? & rdquo ; he point out that Ramot be a primarily haredi area . & ldquo ; we don & rsquo ; t consider ourselves settler ; there be no settler consciousness here . this be happen to we , and what be the response from our rabbi and [ haredi ] politician ? nothing . just to pray . of course we need to , but we also need policy . & rdquo ; Pfeffer lament the imbalance between mks and rabbi , who & ldquo ; can speak up on religious matter & ndash ; which be important & ndash ; but so be people & rsquo ; s live . if you have the privilege to be in power , you can not sit on the sideline . it be up to [ the politician ] to come up with some type of policy . & rdquo ; ARABS who live in east Jerusalem choose to remain anonymous when speak with the Magazine . one say that he think that & ldquo ; the silent majority of east Jerusalemites don & rsquo ; t like attack on civilian because it hurt they more than it benefit they . however , I think the majority see attack on soldier and police as a win . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; other express outrage at the deadly shooting at the Neveh Ya & rsquo ; acov synagogue , say that & ldquo ; attack on those leave prayer service be cross a line . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; yet it be evident that the general mood among Palestinians in east Jerusalem and the West Bank be reach a boiling point . this be especially true in east Jerusalem . arab there be under complete israeli sovereignty , yet lack the same service that be available to Israelis . this include issue surround passport and visa & ndash ; flash point , as they desire the freedom to travel and work abroad . the reality be bleaker in West Bank city such as Nablus or Jenin , where many attacker come from . what happen go forward ? policymaker be assess how the terror attack will impact tourism and , in turn , the economy . upward of four million people on average visit Jerusalem annually , with tourism a vital economic lifeline . Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan - Nahoum , whose portfolio include tourism , tell the Magazine that & ldquo ; the recent terrorist attack have shake our whole nation and leave we in mourning . I understand the fear and concern among our resident and tourist alike , but Jerusalem be a city of strength and resilience . & ldquo ; it have face and overcome many challenge in the past , and these act of terror will not define it . & rdquo ; she continue that & ldquo ; necessary measure have be take to ensure safety and security . I be confident that Jerusalem will continue to thrive and attract visitor from around the world . & rdquo ; how to respond on an individual level be a question on the mind of many . Ben - Gvir have push for expedite gun license for civilian , point to the fact that many terrorist be stop quickly by armed Israelis . those interview echo this sentiment , express a desire to obtain a license and purchase a gun . some be even carry deterrent such as pepper spray or knife . Elia say he have purchase pepper spray for himself and his family ; other say they keep an eye out for potentially dangerous situation . & nbsp ; arguably , the most frightening reality about the current attack be just how unpredictable they can be . unlike in the past , when attack be often carry out by centralized terror group , today & rsquo ; s terrorist may have no prior history of criminal behavior , yet find themselves so radicalize that they take up arm . & nbsp ; these type of & ldquo ; lone wolf & rdquo ; terrorist have spring up across the world and be also a challenge for Israel & rsquo ; s police force . though there be a common profile of these attacker & ndash ; single and unemployed & ndash ; the provocative rhetoric in the mosque and the proliferation of hateful messaging on social medium be also incite brutal attack on civilian , young and old . where this be lead to be anyone & rsquo ; s guess . will it spiral into an all - out third intifada as some predict ? though many hope not , the possibility be nevertheless be discuss . even the small of perceive provocation , such as Ariel Sharon & rsquo ; s 2000 visit to the Temple Mount , can spiral out of control and be the catalyst of wide - scale disturbance . Levy point out that the lack of action or change in the political realm ensure that the status quo of terror will continue . & ldquo ; our political figure have not be pursue the change that we need . & rdquo ; as a result , & ldquo ; it make no sense that child should have to be kill by a ramming at a bus stop before Shabbat or that old people should be kill as they exit a synagogue after prayer . & rdquo ; Elia believe politician like Ben - Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich be aim for escalation , as & ldquo ; it can help reach a determination in the conflict . & rdquo ; in any case , it be clear from these discussion that despite the uptick in violence , no one be make plan to leave the country . this be their home , nowhere else . with that in mind , no amount of attack can stop people from continue to move to the capital and start family . ",what do jerusalemites think about security on the streets?

"" there be a number of possible scenario about how this could play out . if Israel have direct palestinian witness testimony or videographic evidence to incriminate the director , he could actually be bring to trial before special civilian court or israeli military court on those charge and could be potentially sentence to prison time in Israel . alternatively , Israel may not have such direct incriminate evidence , and its evidence may be more ambiguous , such as the idea that it would be impossible for any reasonable director to be completely oblivious to the sheer volume of use by Hamas of his hospital . in this case , it might still try to mount a case for some kind of easy to prove more minor charge , such as aid and abet terrorism without even be a member of a terror group . yet another possibility be that the Shin Bet hope to scare he into provide they intelligence information to more quickly uncover the remain aspect of Hamas 's conceal presence at Shifa , in which case if he cooperate , he may be release with no charge . even if a case be bring against he , he could always defend against any conviction by claim his life be under threat and that any passive cooperation he provide to Hamas be under coercion and duress , or be for the benefit of his patient , who Hamas might otherwise kill . this could make he difficult to convict . in all scenario , detain he will be complex globally , as generally democracy do not detain senior medical staff who be not their citizen .

"& nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s right to self - defense and to its ancient biblical capital of Jerusalem suffer a blow on Friday when an International Criminal Court ( ICC ) rule advance the possibility of war crime suit against Israelis . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; if the International Criminal Court be make a list of so - call israeli [ war crime ] suspect , I ask that my name be put a the top of that list , & rdquo ; Yamina party head Naftali Bennett say on Sunday . & nbsp ; it be not just a statement of bravado against the high international criminal judiciary body . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; as a former defense minister , there be a very real possibility that he could one day be target by the court . & nbsp ; for the Palestinians , the ICC ruling offer a ray of hope to hold Israel accountable for allege human right abuse . & nbsp ; upon hear of the ruling , Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh respond by state that perpetrator of crime will & ldquo ; not go unpunished . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; for many Israelis the idea that the court plan to target they with respect to action in Gaza and israeli settlement activity , but have not hold human right abuser in Iran , Syria and or China accountable , speak to the continue bias of international organization against the jewish state . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; but how real be the possibility of war crime suit ? who would be target and for what ? & nbsp ; & nbsp ; how harmful or helpful be the ruling to either Israel or the Palestinian Authority , which first turn to the court in 2015 and ask that it adjudicate war crime suit ? & nbsp ; 1 . be the probe only focus on Israel ? & nbsp ; no . the ICC will examine action by both israeli and Palestinians , include Hamas . but the probe be launch at the request of Palestinians and be expect to overwhelmingly focus on activity by Israelis against Palestinians . & nbsp ; 2 . can all israeli and or Palestinians action be consider war crime ? & nbsp ; no . the ICC will examine activity that occur since June 13 , 2014 . the scope of the probe be also limit to only those incident which occur over the pre - 1967 line in east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza . this include Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Old City , the Western Wall and the Temple Mount , know to Muslims as al - Haram al - Sharif . Israelis be liable for such action , even though Israel be not a party to the Rome Statute which govern the ICC . the Palestinian Authority , in contrast , sign the statute in 2015 . & nbsp ; 3 . what three main issue will the ICC likely probe ? & nbsp ; the first be the 2014 Gaza war , include the question of disproportionate attack by the IDF and indiscriminate rocket attack by armed palestinian group in Gaza , include Hamas . & nbsp ; the second be IDF use of lethal force against the Hamas - lead & ldquo ; Great March of Return & rdquo ; along the Gaza border , which begin in March 2018 and end in December 2019 . & nbsp ; Third , the ICC would also look at the issue of whether settlement activity in the West Bank and jewish building in east Jerusalem , since that June 2014 date , could be consider a war crime . Israel & rsquo ; s raze of palestinian structure could be examine tangentially , but not as the main focus . & nbsp ; other incident since that date could also be probe in the future , but the main immediate thrust be expect to be these three issue . & nbsp ; 4 . be the state and or individual Israelis at risk ? & nbsp ; both . on the policy level , Israel fear that a negative ruling on matter relate to Gaza would ultimately raise question about Israel & rsquo ; s right to self - defense and make it difficult for the IDF to operate against threat to the state and its citizen , particularly on Israel & rsquo ; s southern border . & nbsp ; a negative ruling on settlement and jewish building in east Jerusalem , Israel fear , would undercut its legal claim to historical and religious right to its ancient biblical territory and its legal claim to be indigenous to that territory . & nbsp ; if the Palestinians be successful at the ICC , then israeli activity in both its biblical heartland of Judea and Samaria , otherwise know as the West Bank , and in its ancient capital of Jerusalem , would be a war crime . & nbsp ; the security cabinet mention the absurdity of both claim when it issue a statement against the ICC ruling on Sunday . & nbsp ; on the individual level , war crime suit could be level against people and not the state . this mean that leader such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Moshe Ya & rsquo ; alon , who hold that post during the 2014 Gaza War , and Avigdor Liberman , who be defense minister when the Great March begin . Defense Minister Benny Gantz and his predecessor Bennett could also be target along with individual soldier and commander . & nbsp ; 5 . what be Friday & rsquo ; s rule and why do it matter ? & nbsp ; the ICC & rsquo ; s Pre - Trial Chamber rule 2 - 1 that the court & rsquo ; s & nbsp ; Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda have the jurisdiction to open an investigation into potential israeli and palestinian war crime on territory over the pre - 1967 line in the West Bank , Gaza and east Jerusalem . Jurisdiction be one of the early and most global ground on which the threat of an ICC war crime suit could have be avert both on the issue of Gaza and the settlement , have the three judge rule against jurisdiction . & nbsp ; their decision in support of jurisdiction can & rsquo ; t be appeal at this stage . the argument against jurisdiction can only be reopen at a late phase in the process , once individual charge have be file to the court for approval . & nbsp ; 6 . do the court & rsquo ; s jurisdictional ruling include recognition of Palestine as a state ? & nbsp ; no . the Pre - Trial Chamber specifically state that such a move be outside of its purview , but it say that it could be consider as such solely for the purpose of these issue of adjudicate war crime . & nbsp ; the basis of its ruling strengthen the status of de facto palestinian statehood and the role of the United Nations in determine that status . the ruling upgrade the significance of the 2012 UN General Assembly Resolution that grant the Palestinians the status of a non - member state by legitimize the de facto status it grant the PA to have the right of member state to sign UN treaty and statue , include the Rome Statute . it be that signature which open the possibility of war crime suit . & nbsp ; the Pre - Trial Chamber also rely on the text of that resolution to set the territory on which it have jurisdiction . it be a move that upgrade the legal status and impact of such resolution , particularly with respect to the israeli - palestinian conflict . & nbsp ; 7 . how significant be the dissent opinion ? & nbsp ; ICC Judge P & eacute ; ter Kov & aacute ; cs disagree with his two other peer ; Reine Ad & eacute ; la & iuml ; de Sophie Alapini - Gansou and Marc Perrin de Brichambau , as well as with Bensouda herself . he say that Palestine could not be consider a de facto state for the purpose of the tribunal and that the court & rsquo ; s jurisdiction could not be fully extend to Gaza , the West Bank and east Jerusalem . & nbsp ; he take particular issue with the reliance his peer and Bensouda place on the UNGA & rsquo ; s 2012 resolution , which he say be non - binding and do not carry the legal weight attribute to it . & nbsp ; in a strongly word 168 - page option , that be long than the original 60 - page one issue by the Pre - Trial chamber , he bring into evidence statement by PA official themselves as well as the UN , to the effect that Palestine be not yet consider to be a state . & nbsp ; Kov & aacute ; cs argument lend legal weight to Israel & rsquo ; s contention that Palestine can not be consider a state . they reflect a lack of legal unanimity on the issue with the court and can be use later to bolster appeal claim . & nbsp ; 8 . what be the next step ? & nbsp ; Bensouda would inform the party and the court that she have open an investigation , at which time they would have 30 day to respond . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; among the critical aspect of her investigation be the question of whether the Israelis or the Palestinians have adjudicate or would adjudicate issue with regard to Gaza and the settlement , accord to Israel Democracy Institute Vice President of Research and legal expert prof . Yuval Shany . the ICC be call into play often only in situation where the national court system be non - existent or have not address the pertinent issue , he explain . & nbsp ; it be at this stage that israeli probe or potential probe into criminal activity by its soldier in Gaza could sway Bensouda not to move forward on war crime allegation with regard to Gaza , Shany say . & nbsp ; Israel have not simultaneously hold criminal investigation into settlement activity & ndash ; which it consider to be legal & ndash ; and thus Bensouda be likely to move the matter of settlement forward to the phase of individual criminal charge . & nbsp ; those charge against individual either with respect to Gaza or the settlement must be confirm with the court . it be at that phase that individual charge could appeal , include on jurisdictional ground , Shany say . & nbsp ; the timing of the matter be likely to be crucial , since Bensouda & rsquo ; s term as chief prosecutor be slate to end in June and a new prosecutor will make decision on the case .",eight things to know about the icc war crimes suits against israel

"Iron Dome always have a weakness . it shoot down 85 % - 90 % of Hamas rocket in past round of battle & ndash ; and that be out of the one which be project to land in populated area . as long as the volume of rocket Hamas could shoot in a single salvo be small , this be almost a hermetic defense . but israeli intelligence and national security official have long warn that Hezbollah have a sufficient number of rocket to pound the jewish state with over 1 , 000 rocket in a day , an amount that could pierce the Iron Dome shield . this be one reason the IDF have be so careful when it come to Hezbollah . the terror group have 150 , 000 or more rocket , include hundred of advanced one , which mean that 1 , 000 per day wouldn & rsquo ; t even dent its arsenal . have Hamas now find its own way to undermine Iron Dome ? during the 2014 Gaza War , Hamas fire almost 4 , 000 rocket , but that be spread out over 50 day . it usually fire dozen of rocket in a day at most , and spread they out over the day . its high be around 200 rocket spread over a whole day & ndash ; and out of the 50 day of the war , it fire more than 100 rocket per day for only around two week . also , the vast majority of these rocket be fire at the Gaza corridor since Hamas have a limited number of rocket capable of reach Tel Aviv and other area . for more on rocket attack against Israel & nbsp ; read here for more on israeli strike on Gaza & nbsp ; read here for more on live rocket attack update & nbsp ; read here for more on riot in Israel & nbsp ; read here for more on world reaction to Gaza violence & nbsp ; read here & nbsp ; but on Tuesday and Wednesday morning , Hamas appear to succeed in fire more than 100 rocket within minute , include a sizable number focus on Tel Aviv . this be a jump both in the number of rocket be use against Tel Aviv , and in the terrorist group & rsquo ; s ability to fire a high volume of rocket simultaneously . this be an ability that Hezbollah be know to have , but be think to be some time away still for Hamas . do this mean the Iron Dome be no long effective ? no . it still intercept the majority of rocket fire at israeli population center although some be get through . the big question be whether israeli intelligence estimate be correct that Hamas have only a few hundred missile which can reach Tel Aviv . if those estimate be accurate , then Hamas may have use up a large chunk of that arsenal , even if it have thousand more which can hit Beersheba , Ashdod and community near the Gaza border . but if Hamas have more of those long - range rocket , this could impact Israel & rsquo ; s plan for this round of violence and especially the question of how long it want it to last . if Hamas can pierce the missile shield with 100 rocket in a few minute twice in one day , how much more damage can Hezbollah and Iran do with the long , large and more accurate missile it possess ? israeli decision - maker and military strategist will need to take this into account in decide how long this can go on for and how quickly they will need to either escalate with a ground offensive to reduce Hamas rocket fire ( clearly the IDF & rsquo ; s extensive bombing on Tuesday do not succeed in that sufficiently ) or to find its way to a ceasefire more quickly and make new plan for the next round . the IDF will also need to rethink the speed with which it will need to move in a conflict with Hezbollah , let alone Iran .",is iron dome effective against hamas rockets as originally thought?
