"since the start of the israel - gaza war , follow the hamas attack of 7 october , the override fear have be that the conflict could spill over into something even deadly . the day after the hamas assault , lebanon 's most powerful armed group hezbollah fire guide rocket and shell into israel in solidarity with hamas , prompt israeli drone and artillery retaliation . could israel , traumatise and vulnerable , with a prime minister fight for political survival , decide the threat from across its northern border in lebanon need to be neutralise ? the fear have be that benjamin netanyahu 's government might be tempt into a second front in the war , against hezbollah - which , like hamas , be intent on destroy the jewish state . and if so , would it draw in iran , hezbollah 's key patron in the region and swear enemy of the we ? this week israel carry out more air strike on the bekaa valley , deep into lebanon , take the death toll in lebanon since the start of the conflict to more than 240 . in retaliation , hezbollah fire a barrage of 100 katyusha rocket on northern israel , its heavy attack since the war begin , with target include israeli army basis in the golan height . at least 17 israelis have be kill in attack from lebanon and syria since october . the rocket this week prompt an angry post by israel 's far - right national security minister itamar ben - gvir , address to the defence minister yoav gallant : "" the military be your responsibility . what be you wait for ? we have to start respond , attack - war , now ! "" last month , chief of staff of the israel defence force ( idf ) herzi halevi say : "" we be now focus on be prepare for war in the north . "" for long , it seem that the clash on the border be carefully calibrate around unspoken red line to avoid escalation into all - out war . hassan nasrallah , the leader of hezbollah , have not call for it . memory in lebanon be still fresh of the disastrous 2006 war with israel , which leave more than 1 , 000 lebanese dead . and israel know that hezbollah 's military capability be far great than that of hamas . a poll publish in the country 's maariv newspaper last month show that 71 % of respondent favour a large - scale military operation to drive hezbollah back . sarit zehavi live close to the lebanese border and head the alma research centre , which specialise on the threat there . she say hezbollah 's aim be "" to drag israel into war without actually initiate it "" . but , she argue , israel be not look for all - out confrontation . "" israel 's interest be to avoid full scale war - but achieve an improved security situation , while damaging hezbollah 's brigade as much as possible . for israel , it be about choose the least bad option : we understand the capability of hezbollah here and the cost of war . "" she believe that hezbollah 's use of rocket , which have a long range than anti - tank missile use previously by the group , be evidence of a shift in the group 's military tactic and capability . "" hezbollah take into consideration the cost of a war , but they do not look into the near future - they look year ahead . "" "" they have already gain by force the evacuation of ten of thousand of israelis , "" she add - about 60 , 000 israelis live in community close to the border have flee the fighting since october , the large such displacement in israeli history . around 100 , 000 lebanese resident have also be move from the other side of the border . to allow for the evacuee to return , israel want to push hezbollah 's force back beyond the litani river , which mark a buffer zone of sort between beirut and the israeli border . as part of the agreement to end the 2006 war , the area south of the litani be suppose to be clear of military presence except for that of the lebanese army and un forces - which hezbollah have violate . that be be part of discussion with amos hochstein , the us special envoy , who have be repeatedly dispatch to the region to avert an escalation . but a deal on hezbollah 's withdrawal and disarmament remain elusive . so far , both benjamin netanyahu and hezbollah appear to be hold back from the precipice . the israeli army be already stretch in gaza , without open a new front - and a new wave of international tension . and hezbollah be in reactive mode , opt more for a low - level war of attrition . but the real risk be miscalculation , and cave into compete pressure . mr netanyahu be batter by the perception that he leave his country vulnerable to the bad attack in its history , revile by family of the hostage who want he to strike a deal to bring they back , and excoriate by the west over the mount civilian casualty in gaza . the fear be that he may see expand the fight in lebanon as key to his political survival - and that israel , in the wake of the 7 october attack , would not countenance the continue threat on its northern front without take military action . professor hilal khashan , from the american university in beirut , believe israel 's relative restraint so far do not tell the true story . "" netanyahu clearly want war , "" he say , point to israel 's strike on about 4 , 000 position across lebanon since october . "" he be finish politically and when the war stop , he will have to face his reckoning , "" he say . "" I do not think he will give a damn about what the we or europe will think - he have make up his mind on hezbollah . "" a further , and potentially more serious , unknown would be the response from iran , which rely on hezbollah , its proxy in lebanon , as a bulwark against israel . since the hamas attack , tehran have flex its muscle across the middle east . iran - back group have hit we military basis in iraq and syria , and yemen 's houthi rebel , align with iran , have launch countless strike on ship in the red sea . it have so far stop short of an unfettered war . but major israeli strike on hezbollah could change tehran 's calculus . in lebanon , there be little appetite for full conflict with israel , particularly among religious group that do not belong to the shia branch of islam to which hezbollah belong . "" non - shia be almost unanimously opposed , and want hezbollah to disarm , "" say professor khashan . but shias be unhappy about the fighting too , he say . "" by and large , they do not want war either . "" hassan nasrallah have say that he will not agree to a ceasefire with israel before there be a truce in gaza . he be report to have tell an iranian military leader last month that he do not want iran to get suck into a war with israel or the united states - and that in the case of a full offensive with israel , hezbollah would fight on its own . still fear stalk those live on either side of a perilous border .

"if you want to map the path to a healthy , function palestinian government , you probably would not start from here . the last time palestinians have the chance to vote for their national leader be 18 year ago , and those election spark a civil war in palestinian politic . that be not a metaphor : hamas , which win the election , and fatah , the big political faction , be shoot each other in gaza 's street . the fighting end with hama take control of gaza , and fatah run the occupy west bank through the palestinian authority ( pa ) . it be a political cold war that last for a generation . that be where this journey start . the 7 october hamas attack on israel , and the war in gaza , rip that picture to shred : israel say it be intent on eliminate hama as a governing and military force in gaza . international eye have turn towards the pa as the vehicle that might - with enough reform - carry palestinians into a new , united post - war era . there be many challenge ahead . the first be credibility . the gaza war might have explode palestinian politic , but one of the few thing it have not change be disillusionment with the pa , the body that the us be bank on to take charge of gaza . it be widely see as corrupt and inefficient , and - by some - as a security enforcer for the israeli government in the west bank . a poll this week by the respect palestinian centre for policy and survey research in ramallah suggest that a majority of palestinians think the pa should be dissolve . and satisfaction with its president in the west bank , mahmoud abbas , be just 8 % . mr abbas have replace his prime minister , mohammad shtayyeh , in an effort to signal reform - or "" renewal "" as the american government have term it . but it have not really move the dial . the new prime minister , an economist call mohammad mustafa , have be task with head a technocratic interim government , and bring together all the palestinian political faction - include hamas - to find some sort of consensus around a new unified vision for the future . and that be the second challenge : unity . sabri saidam , a senior fatah official , tell I that the resignation of the government be design to "" open up the floor "" to other faction - like hamas - and give they "" the space to reconsider their political stance , and their obligation in the future - and also their role , give the change that have happen since 7 october "" . "" we have be talk to hamas indirectly , "" he say . "" we have restate the importance of adhere to the [ â_x0080 _ ¦ ] two - state solution , "" refer to the idea that israelis and palestinians could live side - by - side in separate country . "" and we have receive positive sign . "" last month , representative from fatah and hamas sit down in moscow with other palestinian faction to discuss a way forward . it be see as a positive sign that hamas back a statement from that meeting , pledge support for the palestine liberation organisation ( plo ) , an umbrella group for palestinian political movement that negotiate a previous peace deal with israel . but that feelgood moment in moscow be quickly shatter when hamas react furiously to the appointment of mr mustafa , accuse mahmoud abba of act unilaterally and take "" empty step "" without national consensus . "" hamas do not react the way we have anticipate , "" say sabri saidam , although he believe it follow a familiar pattern of behaviour by the group . "" we hear some positive remark [ from hamas ] , but then when it come to practical engagement , there be always a setback , "" he tell I . "" this time , thing have to be different . we do not have the luxury of time to play with word without walk the talk . "" fatah hit back , accuse hamas of trigger "" a catastrophe "" for the palestinian people by attack israel on 7 october ; a catastrophe that be bad , it say , than the displacement of hundred of thousand of palestinians in 1948 , when the israeli state be create . sabri saidam say the party be now wait to see whether this incident mark the end of hamas talk to the plo , "" or be just a reflection of the chaos hamas be in "" . it be early day , but so far the "" renewal "" of the pa have not yet deliver either unity with rival political faction , or credibility with the palestinian people . election - and a new leader - might help with both . "" it be so depressing to be 33 - year - old - like I be now - and I have not vote even once in my country , "" say arab barghouti , son of the jailed political leader marwan barghouti . "" people my age be minister or parliament member in many other country , but for we it be a dream to vote , "" he tell I . "" we need that renewal in the whole system - and that can only happen with election . "" arab 's father marwan - currently serve five life sentence for murder in an israeli jail - be probably the most popular figure in palestinian politic . his supporter call he the palestinian mandela . he be one of few figure who could potentially unite the different palestinian faction . and his name be likely to be near the top of the list of palestinian prisoner that hamas would want release in exchange for free israeli hostage hold in gaza . but barghouti be block from a previous prisoner exchange deal in 2011 , and israel 's government have little incentive to agree to his release now . the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , have proudly declare that he will block the formation of a palestinian state and be widely see as having promote division between the west bank and gaza as a way of do that . a popular , unifying figure like barghouti - convict of murder israelis - be the last person he want lead the palestinians . mahmoud abbas also have much to fear from his release . in their polling , the palestinian centre for policy and survey research pit marwan barghouti against both mahmoud abbas , and ismail haniyeh from hamas . marwan barghouti would win by a mile against either of they , the projection suggest . there be other figure who be see as potential bridge - maker - mohamme dahlan be one - but even a unifying figure , or credible election , will not solve all the problem face palestinian politic . it will not , for example , solve the problem of what to do with hamas . to what extent hamas still hold power in gaza , after more than five month of war , be complicated and difficult to assess . there have be report of law and order break down , and of armed gang link to gaza 's big family compete for resource . but hamas fighter be still confront israeli force across the gaza strip , most of its top leadership still appear to be free , and israel say several hamas battalion remain intact in the southern border town of rafah . even the civilian committee responsible for distribute aid in gaza city be overwhelmingly affiliate with hamas , one resident say . any new administration in gaza will need to have at least the tacit support of the group or face ongoing friction , or an insurgency . the dilemma will be how to give hama a voice - even a discreet one - without trigger resistance from influential outside power like the us - and , of course , from israel , which be also try to veto any role for the pa in gaza . that dilemma be compound by continue support for hamas across both palestinian territory . support spike in the first few month of the war , and now seem to be fall a bit , but a majority of those interview by the palestinian centre for policy and survey research say they want hama to run gaza after the war ; only 11 % want the pa to take charge there . the last time palestinians vote in election , in 2006 , hamas win . the chance of they be allow to openly run candidate in any new election be virtually zero - but that do not change the mood on the ground . with israeli force still fight their way through gaza , the new shape of palestinian politic be not yet fix . how the war end - and how strong hamas remain after it - will be key . the us government , among other , have dangle the old familiar prize of a future palestinian state to encourage both palestinian leader and their arab ally to unite around their vision . but the failure of internationally back peace deal - and the institution they create - be already partly what drive support for armed group like hamas . prepare for election be , sabri saidam believe , the big feasible step to restore faith in palestinian politic . the first priority will be reconstruct gaza , he say . "" but my personal take be that , once we engage in reconstruction , it will be extremely helpful if we set an election date within a year - and - a - half . and that the world realise we be serious .

"if you want to map the path to a healthy , function palestinian government , you probably would not start from here . the last time palestinians have the chance to vote for their national leader be 18 year ago , and those election spark a civil war in palestinian politic . that be not a metaphor : hamas , which win the election , and fatah , the big political faction , be shoot each other in gaza 's street . the fighting end with hama take control of gaza , and fatah run the occupy west bank through the palestinian authority ( pa ) . it be a political cold war that last for a generation . that be where this journey start . the 7 october hamas attack on israel , and the war in gaza , rip that picture to shred : israel say it be intent on eliminate hama as a governing and military force in gaza . international eye have turn towards the pa as the vehicle that might - with enough reform - carry palestinians into a new , united post - war era . there be many challenge ahead . the first be credibility . the gaza war might have explode palestinian politic , but one of the few thing it have not change be disillusionment with the pa , the body that the us be bank on to take charge of gaza . it be widely see as corrupt and inefficient , and - by some - as a security enforcer for the israeli government in the west bank . a poll this week by the respect palestinian centre for policy and survey research in ramallah suggest that a majority of palestinians think the pa should be dissolve . and satisfaction with its president in the west bank , mahmoud abbas , be just 8 % . mr abbas have replace his prime minister , mohammad shtayyeh , in an effort to signal reform - or "" renewal "" as the american government have term it . but it have not really move the dial . the new prime minister , an economist call mohammad mustafa , have be task with head a technocratic interim government , and bring together all the palestinian political faction - include hamas - to find some sort of consensus around a new unified vision for the future . and that be the second challenge : unity . sabri saidam , a senior fatah official , tell I that the resignation of the government be design to "" open up the floor "" to other faction - like hamas - and give they "" the space to reconsider their political stance , and their obligation in the future - and also their role , give the change that have happen since 7 october "" . "" we have be talk to hamas indirectly , "" he say . "" we have restate the importance of adhere to the [ … ] two - state solution , "" refer to the idea that israelis and palestinians could live side - by - side in separate country . "" and we have receive positive sign . "" last month , representative from fatah and hamas sit down in moscow with other palestinian faction to discuss a way forward . it be see as a positive sign that hamas back a statement from that meeting , pledge support for the palestine liberation organisation ( plo ) , an umbrella group for palestinian political movement that negotiate a previous peace deal with israel . but that feelgood moment in moscow be quickly shatter when hamas react furiously to the appointment of mr mustafa , accuse mahmoud abba of act unilaterally and take "" empty step "" without national consensus . "" hamas do not react the way we have anticipate , "" say sabri saidam , although he believe it follow a familiar pattern of behaviour by the group . "" we hear some positive remark [ from hamas ] , but then when it come to practical engagement , there be always a setback , "" he tell I . "" this time , thing have to be different . we do not have the luxury of time to play with word without walk the talk . "" fatah hit back , accuse hamas of trigger "" a catastrophe "" for the palestinian people by attack israel on 7 october ; a catastrophe that be bad , it say , than the displacement of hundred of thousand of palestinians in 1948 , when the israeli state be create . sabri saidam say the party be now wait to see whether this incident mark the end of hamas talk to the plo , "" or be just a reflection of the chaos hamas be in "" . it be early day , but so far the "" renewal "" of the pa have not yet deliver either unity with rival political faction , or credibility with the palestinian people . election - and a new leader - might help with both . "" it be so depressing to be 33 - year - old - like I be now - and I have not vote even once in my country , "" say arab barghouti , son of the jailed political leader marwan barghouti . "" people my age be minister or parliament member in many other country , but for we it be a dream to vote , "" he tell I . "" we need that renewal in the whole system - and that can only happen with election . "" arab 's father marwan - currently serve five life sentence for murder in an israeli jail - be probably the most popular figure in palestinian politic . his supporter call he the palestinian mandela . he be one of few figure who could potentially unite the different palestinian faction . and his name be likely to be near the top of the list of palestinian prisoner that hamas would want release in exchange for free israeli hostage hold in gaza . but barghouti be block from a previous prisoner exchange deal in 2011 , and israel 's government have little incentive to agree to his release now . the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , have proudly declare that he will block the formation of a palestinian state and be widely see as having promote division between the west bank and gaza as a way of do that . a popular , unifying figure like barghouti - convict of murder israelis - be the last person he want lead the palestinians . mahmoud abbas also have much to fear from his release . in their polling , the palestinian centre for policy and survey research pit marwan barghouti against both mahmoud abbas , and ismail haniyeh from hamas . marwan barghouti would win by a mile against either of they , the projection suggest . there be other figure who be see as potential bridge - maker - mohamme dahlan be one - but even a unifying figure , or credible election , will not solve all the problem face palestinian politic . it will not , for example , solve the problem of what to do with hamas . to what extent hamas still hold power in gaza , after more than five month of war , be complicated and difficult to assess . there have be report of law and order break down , and of armed gang link to gaza 's big family compete for resource . but hamas fighter be still confront israeli force across the gaza strip , most of its top leadership still appear to be free , and israel say several hamas battalion remain intact in the southern border town of rafah . even the civilian committee responsible for distribute aid in gaza city be overwhelmingly affiliate with hamas , one resident say . any new administration in gaza will need to have at least the tacit support of the group or face ongoing friction , or an insurgency . the dilemma will be how to give hama a voice - even a discreet one - without trigger resistance from influential outside power like the us - and , of course , from israel , which be also try to veto any role for the pa in gaza . that dilemma be compound by continue support for hamas across both palestinian territory . support spike in the first few month of the war , and now seem to be fall a bit , but a majority of those interview by the palestinian centre for policy and survey research say they want hama to run gaza after the war ; only 11 % want the pa to take charge there . the last time palestinians vote in election , in 2006 , hamas win . the chance of they be allow to openly run candidate in any new election be virtually zero - but that do not change the mood on the ground . with israeli force still fight their way through gaza , the new shape of palestinian politic be not yet fix . how the war end - and how strong hamas remain after it - will be key . the us government , among other , have dangle the old familiar prize of a future palestinian state to encourage both palestinian leader and their arab ally to unite around their vision . but the failure of internationally back peace deal - and the institution they create - be already partly what drive support for armed group like hamas . prepare for election be , sabri saidam believe , the big feasible step to restore faith in palestinian politic . the first priority will be reconstruct gaza , he say . "" but my personal take be that , once we engage in reconstruction , it will be extremely helpful if we set an election date within a year - and - a - half . and that the world realise we be serious . "" for the past two decade , sea - change in palestinian politic have be rare - and sometimes violent . despite all this , arab barghouti be optimistic . "" we palestinians do not have the privilege of be hopeless , "" he tell I . "" if we lose hope , we lose our country , we lose our land . palestinians need hope . we have not have hope in a very long time . """,cornish charity launches emergency aid for gaza

"" allow genocide to happen do not only affect palestinians … , it affect all human being around the world , "" he say . "" if now israel be commit genocide without accountability , tomorrow we do not know which country will claim that genocide have be commit by israel , and [ therefore ] I can commit genocide with no accountability .

"" my father be kidnap from his own home , "" she say . "" he be an 80 - year - old person that be sit in his home with my mother , and he be brutally take from there , and have essentially disappear since . he have no communication , with no - one in the world .

"six month after the hamas attack on israel , war , disease , starvation and death ravage palestinians in gaza . israel be deeply divided , as its prime minister struggle to keep his promise of total victory . the united states , israel 's most essential ally , have turn against the way it be fight the war . with iran vow vengeance for israel 's assassination of a lead iranian general in syria , and month of cross - border conflict with iran 's ally hezbollah in lebanon , the risk of an all - out middle east war be increase . the statistic record the horror of the past six month . more than 33 , 000 gazan , a majority of whom be civilian , have be kill , accord to the health ministry . accord to save the child , 13 , 800 palestinian child in gaza have be kill and over 12 , 009 wound . unicef report at least 1 , 000 child have have one or both leg amputate . about 1 , 200 people , mostly civilian , be kill by hamas on 7 october , and 253 people be take into gaza as hostage . israel say that of 130 hostage still there , at least 34 be dead . a un team report in march that it have "" clear and convincing information "" that hostage have be subject to sexual violence "" include rape , sexualise torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment "" . it say there be "" reasonable ground "" to believe that the violence against hostage be continue . kibbutz nir oz be right on israel 's border with gaza . it feel like a time capsule still stick in the horror of 7 october 2023 . just after first light on that morning , hamas break through the wire . by the time the israeli army arrive in the early afternoon , a quarter of the 400 or so israelis who live there have either be kill by hamas or take hostage . ron bahat show I around . he be a man in his 50 who grow up at nir oz . ron survive with his family through good luck and arm strong enough to hold shut the door of the safe room when hamas enter his house . we walk along the neat line of small house , with garden that be now overgrown . many have bullet hole or be burn out and have not be disturb since the body of the dead be recover . ron point out the home of friend and neighbour who be kill or take as captive to gaza . in one badly damage house , a pile of neatly iron child 's clothe have somehow survive the fire . the family who live there do not . one grim irony be that nir oz be part of a left - wing movement whose member traditionally support the idea of peace with the palestinians . six month after hamas cross into nir oz , ron be not ready to make any concession to gaza . "" look , I wish that there will be a leader to bring some prosperity there , because in the end we must have peace . but anyone who support hamas be an enemy . the moment they leave their weapon , the war will stop . the moment that israel leave its weapon , we will not exist . that be the difference .

"" I do not know , it be too earlyâ_x0080 _ ¦ maybe only when the hostage come back we can start to think about it . we can not think about it now . I have too many friend there , in gaza . "" no - one have be able to show I around the ruin of khan younis or gaza city , or the tent of around 1 . 4 million displace civilian in rafah , in the way ron bahat show I nir oz . that be because international journalist can not report from gaza , as israel and egypt , in control of the border , have not allow they in . the only exception have be invitation - only , highly supervised trip organise by the israel defense force ( idf ) . I have be on one , to northern gaza in early november . only a month or so into the war , israeli firepower have already reduce the area to a wasteland . evidence be accumulate that both hamas and israel may have commit war crime . the international court of justice ( icj ) in the hague be investigate israel for "" plausible "" allegation of genocide against the palestinians in a case bring by south africa . the icj can not try a case against hamas , which be classify as a terrorist organisation by the us and uk , and many other , as it be not a state . israel reject the charge that it be guilty of genocide . for many of its citizen and supporter it be grotesque and offensive to allege that the state create after nazi germany murder six million jews in the holocaust be itself commit genocide . one of israel 's lawyer , tal becker , tell the justice in court in the hague that "" the appalling suffering of civilian , both israeli and palestinian , be first and foremost the result of hamas ' strategy "" . palestinians see the charge through a different lens , shape by year of military occupation by israel . many palestinians believe israel have already create an apartheid state that deny they the most basic right . in jerusalem at easter , a prominent palestinian christian political activist , dimitri diliani , tell I that "" kill child be kill child . it do not matter who be the child that be be kill . it do not matter who be do the killing "" . "" I recognise the holocaust , but that do not mean a green light for israel to commit genocide against my people or any other people . "" the icj 's deliberation will take year and israel 's accuser will have to prove intent to win their case . war and the death of civilian do not add up to genocide on their own . south africa 's legal team argue that statement like the one make by israel 's defence minister yoav gallant on 9 october show genocidal intent . "" I have order a complete siege on the gaza strip . there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything be close , "" he say after visit the idf southern command in beersheba . "" we be fight human animal and we be act accordingly . "" israel be force by international pressure , especially from washington , to loosen aspect of the blockade that the minister envisage . the amount reach gaza be still grossly inadequate . six month later , gaza be face imminent famine , accord to the integrate food security phase classification ( ipc ) a body back by government , the un and aid group to provide rigorous and apolitical information and analysis in a food emergency . oxfam report that 300 , 000 people trap in the north have live since january on an average of 245 calorie a day - the equivalent of a tin of bean . gaza 's humanitarian catastrophe have also be record in detail by palestinian journalist , civilian post on social medium , and the international organisation run the aid operation , whose staff be allow to enter the territory . seven from the world central kitchen ( wck ) , which have be provide million of meal , be kill by the israeli army on 1 april . their death outraged president biden and other western leader who be staunch ally of israel . their condemnation of the killing leave israel even more isolated . israel expect no sympathy from much of the world . but it have come to expect support and understanding from powerful western ally . instead , they have reject israel 's claim it do not impede the movement of relief supply . president biden extract unusually rapid concession from israel , which promise great humanitarian access to gaza in a statement rush out in the middle of the night here in jerusalem . perhaps he threaten to attach condition to the use of american weapon in gaza . the killing of the wck team seem to have be a tipping point for president biden , whose backing for israel have be a constant throughout his long career in politic . support israel be still his firm principle , but the us be no long prepared to turn that into a safety net for benjamin netanyahu and his extremist coalition partner . palestinians ask , with some anger and frustration , why it take the death of seven aid worker , include six westerner , to make a difference , after so many thousand of gazan have be kill . aid agency operate in gaza say the attack on the aid worker be not an isolated incident , but the result of an engraine disregard for the life of palestinian civilian . president biden 's outrage might have be a long time come but it could create a turning point in the war . over the next month or so , one way of assess change be simply to count whether israel be kill few palestinian civilian , or whether increase food and medical aid can save gaza from famine . another test will be whether mr netanyahu defy american opposition and go ahead with a ground assault on rafah , where israel say the remain organise unit of hamas must be destroy . the us say that must not happen until israel can find a way to protect the life of almost 1 . 5 million palestinians who have take refuge there . benjamin netanyahu have deliver the "" mighty vengeance "" he promise israelis on 7 october . his other promise , of total victory , the destruction of hamas , and the return of the hostage have not be achieve . inside israel , he face severe political pressure . his approval rating in opinion poll have plummet . in the past week in jerusalem thousand of protestor wave israeli flag block street around the parliament demand the resignation of the prime minister and new election . "" netanyahu have an interest to lengthen the war as much as he can , because as long as the war be still go on , he can say that now be not the time for new election , "" say nava rosalio , one of the leader of the anti - netanyahu movement . her group be call busha in hebrew , which translate as shame . "" he say now be not the time to look for who be responsible , which be he . so he prefer to keep the hostage in gaza , and he prefer to lengthen the war . "" when hamas attack , israel be deeply divide over his government 's right - wing policy and culture war between secular and religious israelis . in the shock that follow reservist who have suspend their military service as part of the protest rush back into uniform . demonstration be pause in the interest of national unity . six month on , it be no long consider unpatriotic to protest against the failure to end the war and free the hostage . israel 's division be wide open once more . mr netanyahu face searing accusation that his priority be his own political survival . to stay in power , he must preserve his coalition , which be build around the support of ultranationalist jewish party . they do not only oppose the mass release of palestinian security prisoner to buy the freedom of israeli hostage , without which a ceasefire will not happen . mr netanyahu 's two main ultranationalist ally , finance minister bezalel smotrich and national security minister itamar ben - gvir , go far . they both want palestinians to leave gaza so jews can settle there instead . the prime minister , renowne for his skill in the dark art of politic , be perform a balance act to keep they happy while deny that mr smotrich and mr ben - gvir 's view reflect government policy . before october , israel 's division must have make it look vulnerable to hamas . six month on , the same schism within israel about the present and the future be make it hard to win the war . capture or kill yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza and mastermind of the 7 october attack , would give israel a chance to declare victory . but he be still alive , send his response to proposal in successive round of ceasefire talk from wherever he be hide . he be think to be somewhere in the hamas tunnel network , protect by bodyguard and a human shield of israeli hostage . yahya sinwar must be disappoint that palestinians on the west bank , include east jerusalem have not rise up in support of gaza . some must be take the long view , wait to see how event unfold in gaza and the wide middle east . other be struggle to feed their family now that thousand of palestinians be no long allow to work in israel . some be scared . israel have launch many deadly raid against armed group in the west bank , kill innocent bystander in the process and arrest thousand who be be hold without trial . some palestinian farmer have be drive off their land after violent and sometimes deadly intimidation by extremist jewish settler . opinion poll show strong support among palestinians for the attack on 7 october , though many deny the evidence that hamas commit atrocity . at a noisy demonstration against the israelis in ramallah in the west bank , I ask joharah baker , a palestinian activist , whether the hamas attack have move the palestinians any close to independence from israeli rule . she say that be not the point . "" what happen on 7 october be just one thing that happen in many long year of oppressionâ_x0080 _ ¦ our struggle will continue until we be free . that be what any people under occupation , under oppression , under colonial settler will do . "" accord to the lead palestinian pollster , khalil shikaki , even those who dislike hamas approve of the way its attack have put the palestinian desire for independence back on the political map of the middle east . the war have accelerate a new way for that to happen . his late poll indicate that young palestinians do not think the two - state solution of an independent palestine alongside israel will ever emerge . instead , he say , a plurality of under - 30 want a single state between the mediterranean sea and the river jordan , in which they believe they could fight and win democratic right . they compare their fight with the struggle against apartheid in south africa , and believe they have a palestinian nelson mandela wait in an israeli jail . he be marwan barghouti , imprison since 2002 and serve five life sentence for murder . if he run for president , the indication be that he would win easily . even though he be a leader of the rival palestinian faction , fatah , hamas put marwan barghouti 's name on the list of prisoner they want release in exchange for hostage . it be impossible to see jewish israelis ever give up the jewish nature of their state . the fact that palestinians see that as a possibility be another sign of the distance between they . six month into the war , there be no immediate sign that it be end . benjamin netanyahu have avoid any specific about how gaza would be govern when this war end , except for insist that israel must be in control - in other word , an occupation . he have reject america 's proposal to replace israeli troop with a force from the palestinian authority , which administer part of the west bank . the americans want a pa , revitalise , eventually to govern gaza . that would most likely require new leadership . current palestinian president mahmoud abbas be elderly and hugely unpopular . palestinians say he have fail to fight corruption , fail to show sympathy for gaza , and fail to order the palestinian police to protect they from aggressive jewish settler while he continue security cooperation with israel . benjamin netanyahu have also reject joe biden 's idea of a grand bargain that would transform the middle east . in return for allow palestinian independence , israel would be recognise by saudi arabia , and the saudi would get a nato - style defence agreement with the us . instead , the prime minister tell israelis that he be the only man who can save they from the mortal hazard of a palestinian state impose by america . that be music for the ultranationalist in his government , who be much keener to keep the west bank and all of jerusalem than make a deal with saudi arabia . away from the conference room where leader discuss the future , the war have create another enormous obstacle to peace . palestinians and israelis have not be as suspicious of each other since the turbulent decade of assassination , hijacking and war in the 1950 and 60 . the pollster khalil shikaki identify an accelerated mutual process of dehumanisation since 7 october . "" the palestinians be not see as partner for peace . they be not see as people who deserve equality because of what they have do on 7 october . so , they [ israelis ] question their humanity . we see similar development , unfortunately , also among palestinians , who see what be happen in gaza .

"the israeli troop withdrawal from gaza announce on sunday be greet with widespread surprise , even as the israeli army and government have be at pain to stress that it have no great significance . but to a world that have watch the intensity of israel 's bombardment , the idea that there be now just one brigade leave in the entire enclave seem to signify some major shift in the war . and then there be the timing of the announcement - on the very day that mark the grim milestone of six month since the hamas - lead assault on israel ignite this late and bloody phase in the conflict between israel and the palestinians .

"" the formal reason offer by israeli spokesperson for halt the war be operational in nature , but every intelligent person can see that the timing be hardly coincidental . ahead of critical talk , the israeli capitulation be design - without say so explicitly - to signal to hamas that israel be be very forthcoming with it from its perspective . "" ben caspit in the more centrist maariv newspaper be even more forceful in his interpretation of the move . "" if you be to ask netanyahu ( and he be ask ) , this be do to prepare for the promise operation in rafah … there be a second explanation , one that have be report all over the world in every possible language . by that account , the 98th division 's withdrawal from khan yunis be link to talk for a hostage deal . "" serious media outlet around the world have report that the conversation between president biden and prime minister netanyahu be dramatic . biden lead netanyahu to understand that he be not a pace away from victory , but a pace away from the final destruction of the alliance between israel and the united states . "" in public at least , mr netanyahu have continue to ratchet up the rhetoric on rafah , say that a date have be set for the operation . his defence minister , yoav gallant , have be more nuance , tell army recruit that now be an "" opportune "" time to do a deal with hamas . but he stress that a ceasefire would not be the end of the war : "" there will be difficult decision and we will be ready to pay the price in order to get the hostage back , and then return to fighting . "" the fighting be likely to continue , as mr gallant say , but the form it take may change substantially . with criticism of the way the war have be conduct grow from israel 's most powerful ally , the us , the drawing down of force in gaza seem likely in part to be aim at show the biden administration that israel be listen to its concern over civilian casualty and life - threaten aid shortage . an end to bombardment that have reduce city to rubble , as have be see in the late image from khan younis , may go some way to restore the customary whole - hearted support for israel from washington . but that will undoubtedly be test again , if the "" future operation "" that the israeli army say troop be be give rest and recuperation to prepare for mean a full - scale assault on rafah where israel believe hamas 's remain military force be now base , among more than a million displace palestinians . there may be a belief in the israeli government and military that a significant number of that population , squeeze into barely function shelter , may start move back to their home now that the bulk of israeli troop be go . but what palestinians have find on their return to khan younis be mass devastation , with many of their home reduce to rubble . they have describe how gaza 's second city be now unliveable , not even fit for animal , as some have put it . meanwhile , the head of the un agency for palestinian refugee , unrwa , warn palestinians think of head to khan younis about the threat of unexploded munition there follow the israeli pullout . philippe lazzarini tell the bbc there might be thousand of the device in the rubble . so a major exodus from rafah , which would make any israeli operation against hamas less likely to cause a new catastrophic toll of civilian casualty , may not be on the card . but the "" further operation "" may also relate to the conflict on israel 's northern front with hezbollah in lebanon . that confrontation have be steadily escalate since 7 october . and there be fear that it could become far more intense , follow the suspect israeli strike in damascus that kill several senior commander in iran 's powerful revolutionary guard last week . hezbollah be closely ally to iran and have match the rhetoric come from tehran , vow revenge . the israeli army have recently say that it have substantially strengthen its northern command . so , this too may have play a part in the troop withdrawal from gaza . whatever the true motive be - and they be likely to have involve a number of interlock factor - it be unlikely that israel 's military engagement in gaza be anywhere close to come to an end , with hamas fighter already having show their capacity to regroup in area that have be subject to the heavy onslaught from the idf .",israel reveals eurovision song after weeks of wrangling

"iran 's brazen attack directly target israel on saturday mean that the one thing president biden most fear and desperately seek to avert in the wake of the 7 october hamas attack have happen - an escalation of the conflict to the wide region . for the us president , the tightrope he be walk on the israel - gaza war have get even thin , as he seek to both de - escalate the situation and deter iran , while face domestic pressure from both leave and right over the relationship with israel . any ceasefire deal in gaza , meanwhile , hang in the balance . just two week ago , it appear that the us - israel relationship - once the close of close ally - be in serious trouble . president biden be express not just frustration but also outright anger at the lack of humanitarian aid get into gaza and the killing of seven aid worker in a strike by the israel defense force . the level of disagreement be such that the administration make clear it could reconsider its stance towards israel , and possibly even withhold arm export . but iran 's action at the weekend seem to have change all that . the barrage of more than 300 missile and drone fire at israel prompt a highly successful , hand - in - glove military action by the us and israel to defend the country . the co - ordinated action have seemingly rekindle some of the old warmth . and the white house will now be hope it can capitalise on that to influence israel 's response . official be not so naive as to think there will be no response at all , but they want it calibrate in such a way that it can be view as an act of restraint . but the weekend 's joint military success also mask a fundamental and worrying change in the regional situation , accord to former us envoy dennis ross , a 40 - year veteran of us diplomacy in the middle east . iran 's direct retaliation against israeli territory for the targeting of its elite qud force officer in a strike on the iranian consulate in syria have "" rewrite the rule "" of the israel - iran relationship , he say , far destabilise an already precarious situation . iran have spend year build up proxy force swear to israel 's destruction , while funding and arm palestinian group include hamas , as well as the shia militant group hezbollah in lebanon . but saturday mark the first time since the islamic revolution in 1979 that iran have attempt to launch a direct attack on israel . and so , no matter how you spin the success of the military technology that effectively neutralise iran 's action , a rubicon have be cross . that , say mr ross , mean there be a "" failure of deterrent "" towards iran . mr biden now face an uncomfortable paradox , he say . the president have to simultaneously lower the temperature with iran , but at the same time , make tehran understand there be a cost to its action . in the wake of saturday 's attack , the white house make clear it would not join any israeli military retaliation against iran , while assert its commitment to israel 's security remain "" ironclad "" . iran 's direct involvement in the current war will also make reach a ceasefire deal in gaza and the release of hostage kidnap by hama significantly hard . american diplomat have be work around the clock to get israel to agree to a six - week pause in fighting to allow for the release of both hostage from gaza and palestinian prisoner in israeli jail . the agreement would also facilitate the movement of desperately need aid into gaza , where starvation be loom . before the weekend , they have israel 's buy - in and the pressure be on hama . all that be now in jeopardy as the world wait to see how israel will respond . the domestic complication for the president be meanwhile ever present . there be pressure from part of the left to distance himself from israel ; and accusation from the right of weakness in not stand up to iran forcefully enough .

"after month of on - off hard talk between belligerent and mediator , the time have come for hard decision . hamas have agree to a draft ceasefire deal , which be "" far from meet israel 's demand "" , accord to israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu . he have still feel it necessary to dispatch a delegation to discuss it . israel agree to a ceasefire offer at the end of april . the us secretary of state antony blinken say it be "" exceptionally generous "" . a big challenge for the negotiator in cairo be close the gap between israel 's version and the one accept by hamas . diplomatic source in qatar , which be part of the mediation effort with egypt and the united states , tell I "" it be broadly the same as israel 's proposal . just minor wording change and detail "" . israel may decide that the difference be not minor . one major sticking point have be that hamas want a ceasefire to be permanent , not temporary , and to be follow by an israeli withdrawal from gaza . if the us delegation , lead by the cia chief william burn , believe the gap can be bridge , mr netanyahu can expect pressure from washington to agree . until monday evening , israel 's work assumption be that hamas would not accept a ceasefire proposal . benjamin netanyahu and his government , like most foreign observer , be blindside when hamas announce its decision . there be two way of look at the hamas gambit . it can be see as a desperate move by an organisation badly bloody and almost break by israel 's long offensive . or it be an adroit political move , which have turn the pressure back on mr netanyahu . that explanation be more credible , as israel 's plan and assumption be upend by the offer . we know that israel be base its move in the next phase of the war on an assumption that yahya sinwar , the hamas chief in gaza who have be in hiding since 7 october , would never accept a ceasefire . israel use the absence of a ceasefire offer from hamas as an explanation for its decision to launch a military operation in gaza . the us be very clear that it be against any ground operation in rafah that could threaten the life of more palestinian civilian . as israel warn around 100 , 000 palestinians to leave their home at first light on monday , its defence minister yoav gallant tell his us counterpart that there be no alternative to a rafah assault . that , he say , be because hamas have reject every proposal for a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostage . only a few hour later , hamas make its announcement , call israel 's bluff . mr netanyahu be in a political bind . his govern style over more than 16 year as israel 's leader have be characterise by a habit of put off difficult choice . but now he be under severe pressure , from all side , and however tempt it might be to play for time , this be a moment for decision . the most intense pressure come from two ultranationalist jewish extremist in his cabinet - finance minister bezalel smotrich and itamar ben gvir , minister for national security . mr netanyahu need their vote to keep his coalition in power . they want israel to occupy rafah and have threaten to topple the government if he do not make it happen . for they , a ceasefire equal surrender . at the same time , family and supporter of israeli hostage have be demonstrate , block major road to demand that israel make a deal to get they back home . the hostage family have support in the war cabinet from benny gantz and gabi eisenkot , two opposition leader who join the cabinet after the 7 october attack . they might leave the government if , in the absence of a ceasefire , the hostage stay put . the americans also want a deal . president biden 's support for israel , even as its army kill huge number of palestinian civilian , be cost he political support . if mr biden decide that there be an acceptable version of a ceasefire to be have , he will push benjamin netanyahu to support it . the israeli leader would have to choose between his government 's survival and the vital support the us president have give he in recent month . it be widely believe in israel that mr netanyahu want to prolong the war to put off the moment of reckon for his own part in the mistake that give hama its opportunity on 7 october to kill around 1200 people , mostly israelis and take 240 hostage into gaza . a ceasefire would also mean that benjamin netanyahu have not achieve "" total victory "" over hamas - one of his two main war aim . the other be free the hostage , which he have not achieve either . this war be show , once again , how hard it be for powerful country like israel to defeat much weak organisation like hamas . for hamas , survival mean victory , and benjamin netanyahu know that , for he , would be a defeat .",uk forces may be deployed on the ground in gaza to help deliver aid

"after month of stalemate , the search for peace in gaza have reach a critical stage . un chief antonio guterre say it be a "" decisive moment for the palestinian and israeli people and for the fate of the entire region "" . there seem to be common ground between most side about the principle : a ceasefire should take place alongside the release of israeli hostage and palestinian prisoner . various draft agreement have be draw up , set out a complex process of how it would all work . there be some disagreement over the detail of what should happen to whom and when and in what order . israeli official say , for example , that its female soldier should be release early than envisage . they also say the text should be clear that the first 33 hostage to be release must be alive and be worried about not have a veto over which palestinian prisoner would be release . these be issue that could potentially be surmount through negotiation . but there be a more fundamental sticking point about a core principle that may be hard to get past and that be when the war should end . the opening word of the draft agreement - support by hamas - declare that there should be a "" temporary cessation of military operation between the two party "" . this be largely unproblematic . six week would pass while people be release , israeli force withdraw from some area , displace gazan would be able to return to what if anything be leave of their home . but then stage two would begin . the draft agreement then talk about a "" return to sustainable calm "" , which it define as "" a permanent cessation of military and hostile operation "" . it be this that seem to be unacceptable to israel 's government . in a statement , the prime minister benjamin netanyahu say : "" israel will not allow hama to restore its evil rule in the gaza strip , israel will not allow it to restore its military capability to continue strive for our destruction . israel can not accept a proposal that endanger the security of our citizen and the future of our country . "" in other word , israel 's government want the right to continue take the fight to hamas in the long run . by contrast , hamas want a permanent ceasefire . what be not clear be whether there be a way for qatari , egyptian and american negotiator to find a middle path through this . it may be that all of this be part of the negotiation . public statement be frequently use in negotiation to put pressure on the other side . the announcement by hamas that it support a particular draft could be an attempt to push israel into make concession and divide it from its ally . israel 's warning about an imminent military operation in rafah could be an attempt to extract well term from hamas . but the question of whether any ceasefire be permanent or not look hard to square with clever diplomatic language . israel have agree to send a delegation to cairo but with modest ambition - not to hammer out a deal but "" to exhaust the possibility of reach an agreement under condition acceptable to israel "" . much will depend on what the us government decide . so far , we spokespeople have fall over themselves to avoid make any comment on the deal hamas have sign up to . they have limit themselves to assert that an agreement be still "" achievable "" and to warn firmly against a military operation in rafah . that be because if the we be to throw its weight behind the current text , then mr netanyahu might be force to choose between his main ally and the ultra - nationalist hardliner prop up his government who oppose any compromise . mr netanyahu have survive many crisis in his political career by postpone difficult decision . but president biden have it in his gift to force israel 's leader to make a choice that he might rather avoid .",parties pressed over funding of election pledges

"reporter always carry some kind of baggage with they when they head off to cover a story - whether it be the tool of their trade , a camera or a microphone , or something less tangible , such as memory of a past encounter or story . it be on a recent deployment that the bbc 's middle east analyst sebastian usher suddenly notice that the often unwanted companion that seemingly always accompany he on trip abroad have suddenly go missing . I get back from a report trip to jerusalem , with all the usual high and low , and with the backdrop of one of the world 's most utterly enthral city . and I realise on my return that something that habitually accompany I on such trip have be miss . something that I have always somewhat resent , yet also jealously guard as an essential part of who I be . my stutter . even after all these year it be almost always there , just give a little wave as I prepare to do the umpteenth live interview . it be mostly very well - behave these day and surprisingly flexible , even generous . at one time , it would let I know that a certain word - say , "" syria "" - be a no - go . that be fair and mostly allow I a way around it . it have no objection , for instance , to "" syrian territory "" or the "" syrian region "" . have to find fresh phrase can be an asset for a reporter . so it be perfectly liveable - with and to be honest - after a lifetime of listen to that little voice - quite companionable . but high up on the windswept bureau balcony in jerusalem , the voice be silent . there have be time like this before , and it have always return . but who know - this time it might be for good . and it make I feel a little bereft . when I look back , I can not really remember how it start but I do know that it be - to I at least - a relatively unobtrusive part of my childhood . I be lucky to have a relatively shelter , privileged upbringing where if it be note at all , it be see as a vaguely charming mark of distinction . a musty old classic teacher would tell I about the great athenian rhetorician demosthene stand on the beach with stone in his mouth to cure his stutter . it do not really appeal . any time there be some distance that need to be bridge - like speak on a phone or ask for a bus ticket - it could be a problem . anything too formal , too . and I find early on that it be really a stammer , not a stutter . word do not fracture and become staccato . they simply sit in the path like great unblinking toad , slyly prevent anything from get past . but a stutter always sound classier to I , so I have stick with that . it be be everywhere with I - at school , university , work . it be be quite remarkably even - hand in show up in formal or casual situation . and utterly capricious , suddenly come up with an entirely new syllable or consonant to place out of bound . people would ask : be it nerve ? be you very anxious ? which would of course give I anxiety - so I never mention it . this mean that if suddenly , halfway through a sentence , I be strike dumb , people would react as if it be some biblical curse . once in jordan after a 12 - hour bus journey through the endless scrubland from riyadh , I be suddenly unable to sound out a single word , a great imaginary boulder having materialise on my tongue through the night . across the middle east , beyond the endless strife and complication , certain thing be at least clear to I - "" lebanon "" be no problem , "" iraq "" and "" iran "" be easy - "" israel "" too - "" egypt "" a doddle - but "" tunisia "" , "" tel aviv "" and "" turkey "" be temperamental , withdraw access at a moment 's notice . I would try to avoid listen to a fellow correspondent on the same story before go on air , in case my inner voice should triumphantly extricate the key word from their report and place it in quarantine . that voice have however become ever more forgiving and forbear down the year ; now it be mostly a whisper of itself . but it be never go away - or so I think . maybe I be just hold onto it as a precious fragment of a long - lose self - a sense that there be always something latent and untapped that lie beyond the surface . a connection - semi secret - to entire world of people that be go . as she sink ever deeply into alzheimer 's , my mother , who have help make it so that I never feel it a burden or a hindrance , simply deny outright that my stutter have ever exist - a last link break with the past . perhaps it be her gentleness and elegant humour that the trace of sudden silence on my tongue still keep alive . or do . so , the next time I be lose for word , it may simply be because there be none leave to convey what be happen in gaza , israel and beyond .",uk floods hit vegetable supply with carrots imported from israel

"the united nations have revise down the figure it publish for the proportion of woman and child kill in gaza , lead to claim few palestinians have be kill since israel launch its offensive follow the hamas attack of 7 october . on 6 may , the un say that 69 % of report fatality be woman and child . two day later , it say this figure be 52 % . the overall number of report death in gaza - which currently stand at more than 35 , 000 - have not change , but the un now say incomplete information have lead to the revision . the un say it be now rely on figure from the hamas - run health ministry in gaza , rather than from the hamas - run government medium office ( gmo ) . the israeli foreign minister highlight the un 's change , call the lower report death toll for woman and child "" the miraculous resurrection of the dead in gaza "" and accuse the un of rely on "" fake datum from a terrorist organisation "" . the figure have be release in different way by the two separate authority - the gmo and the health ministry - and the un have now switch from quote the former to the latter to break down demographic datum . at the start of the war the health ministry only report death for which detail have be register in hospital , whereas from november , the gmo include an additional category of death record in "" reliable medium report "" . more recently the health ministry have include these medium report compile by the gmo , along with an additional category of death record by family member by fill in an online form . gaza 's health ministry be now therefore report these figure : some of these for which information be miss ( such as an i d number or date of birth ) be include in the overall number of death in the health ministry figure , but be not break down demographically . the number of woman and child kill be deeply contest because it be often interpret as an indication of the number of civilian death . in a recent interview , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu say about 30 , 000 people have be kill in gaza , with 14 , 000 of they be "" terrorist "" and 16 , 000 civilian . he do not provide any evidence for those figure . keep precise record of casualty during wartime be challenge , so it be therefore not unusual for the number report to vary , accord to prof erica charter who specialise in the study of war . the initial figure for how many people be kill in hamas 's 7 october attack be originally put at 1 , 400 by israeli authority , but be later revise down to about 1 , 200 . at the time , the israeli authority say the misidentification of some of the burn body be the reason for the discrepancy . the gmo have consistently give a high figure for the proportion of woman and child in all fatality than have the health ministry . on 6 may , the un report 34 , 735 death - of which there be 9 , 500 woman and 14 , 500 child , cite the gmo as its source . the two day later , the un release a further report , switch its source to the health ministry . the result of this be that although the overall record death toll be almost unchanged ( 34 , 844 ) , the number of register death of woman ( 4 . 959 ) and child ( 7 , 797 ) have both fall significantly . this difference be because those individual with incomplete information be not include in the demographic breakdown . the gmo say the proportion of woman and child kill in the conflict be around 70 % . the un 's late report , cite health ministry datum , say out of 24 , 686 fully identify fatality , 52 % be woman and child , 40 % be man , and 8 % be "" elderly "" , without specify whether they be male or female . it be not clear what age the report consider to be "" elderly "" and how it categorise child . we have do our own analysis of detailed datum release by the health ministry , and also find that 52 % of the fatality be list as woman and child ( anyone under 18 ) . in addition , 43 % be man and another 5 % be "" unknown "" ( miss information such as an age or gender ) . for the gmo 's figure to be compatible with the health ministry 's datum , almost all of the 10 , 000 death not fully identify by the ministry would have to have be woman and child . "" it be not logically impossible . . . but it really strain credibility , "" say prof michael spagat , who specialise in examine death toll in conflict around the world . we ask the gmo why the proportion of woman and child they have record as kill be so much high than in the health ministry 's datum , but they do not provide a direct response to the discrepancy . we also approach the health ministry for comment . prof spagat also tell the bbc that the death toll in gaza be "" staggeringly high "" give the war have only be go on for six month , note that the verified hospital death still represent about 1 % of gaza 's pre - war population of 2 . 4 million . ask by bbc verify why it make the change , the un say it use the gmo datum for woman and child kill because the health ministry have not be publish these figure .

"" the outrage express by the prime minister , and echo by israel 's political leadership , be generate by page of carefully choose legal language in a statement issue by mr khan , the icc chief prosecutor who be a british king 's counsel . word by word , line by line , they add up to a devastating series of allegation against the three most prominent leader of hamas as well as israel 's prime minister and defence minister . a determination to apply international law and the law of armed conflict to all party , no matter who they be , lie at the heart of mr khan 's statement in which he lay out his justification for request arrest warrant . "" no foot soldier , no commander , no civilian leader - no one - can act with impunity . "" the law , he say , can not be apply selectively . if that happen , "" we will be create condition for its collapse "" . it be the decision to hold both side ' conduct up to the template of international law that be cause so much anger , and not just in israel . us president joe biden say it be "" outrageous "" to apply for arrest warrant . there be "" no equivalence - none - between israel and hamas "" . hamas demand the withdrawal of the allegation against its leader , claim that the icc 's prosecutor be "" equate the victim with the executioner "" . it say the request to issue arrest warrant for the israeli leadership come seven month too late , after "" the israeli occupation commit thousand of crime "" . mr khan do not make direct comparison between the two side , except to lay out his claim that they have both commit a series of war crime and crime against humanity . he also emphasise that this late war come in the context of "" an international armed conflict between israel and palestine , and a non - international armed conflict between israel and hamas "" . the court treat palestine as a state as it have observer status at the united nations , which mean it be able to sign up to the rome statute which create the icc . mr netanyahu have declare that palestinians will never have independence on his watch . instead of see disgraceful and false parallel between , as israel 's president isaac herzog put it , "" these atrocious terrorist and a democratically elect government of israel "" , human right group have applaud the way that the icc prosecutor be seek to apply the law to both side . b'tselem , a lead israeli human right organisation , say the warrant mark "" israel 's rapid decline into a moral abyss "" . "" the international community be signal to israel that it can no long maintain its policy of violence , killing and destruction without accountability , "" it add . human right campaigner have complain for many year that powerful western country , lead by the us , turn a blind eye to israeli violation of international law , even as they condemn and sanction other state who be not in their camp . the action be take by mr khan and his team be , they believe , long overdue . mr khan say that the three main leader of hamas commit war crime that include extermination , murder , hostage - taking , rape and torture . the man name be yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza , mohammed deif , the commander of the qassam brigade , its military wing , and ismail haniyeh , head of the hamas political bureau . as part of their investigation , karim khan and his team interview victim and survivor of the 7 october attack . he say hamas have assault fundamental human value : "" the love within a family , the deep bond between a parent and a child be contort to inflict unfathomable pain through calculate cruelty and extreme callousness "" . israel , mr khan say , do have the right to defend itself . but "" unconscionable crime "" do not "" absolve israel of its obligation to comply with international humanitarian law "" . the failure to do that , he say , justify issue warrant for the arrest of mr netanyahu and defence minister yoav gallant for crime include starvation of civilian as a weapon of war , murder , extermination , and intentional attack on civilian . from the start of israel 's response to the hamas attack of 7 october , president biden have issue a series of rebuke to israel , express concern that it be kill too many palestinian civilian and destroy too much civilian infrastructure in gaza . but in a careful balancing act with a close ally which he have always support , mr biden and his administration have not spell out in public about what they mean . mr khan make his interpretation crystal clear . israel , he say , have choose criminal mean to achieve its war aim in gaza - "" namely , intentionally cause death , starvation , great suffering , and serious injury "" to civilian . a panel of judge at the icc now will consider whether to issue the arrest warrant . state sign up to the icc 's rome statute would then be oblige to detain the man if they have the chance . the 124 signatory do not include russia , china and the us . israel have not sign either . but the icc have rule that it do have legal authority to prosecute criminal act in the war because the palestinians be signatory . if the arrest warrant be issue , it would mean that mr netanyahu , israel 's long - serve prime minister , would not be able to visit close western ally without risk arrest . uk prime minister rishi sunak say the icc 's action be "" not helpful to reach a pause in the fighting , get hostage out or humanitarian aid in "" . but if the warrant be issue , britain would have to make the arrest , unless it could argue successfully that mr netanyahu have diplomatic immunity . an all - important exception for mr netanyahu and mr gallant be the we . the white house believe the icc do not have jurisdiction in the conflict , a position that might widen the split inside joe biden 's democratic party over the war . progressive have already welcome the icc 's action . staunch ally of israel among the democrats might support republican move to pass a law to sanction icc official or ban they from the us . as rumour of impending indictment churn through europe , america and the middle east week ago , a group of republican senator issue the kind of threat to mr khan and his staff that they might have hear in a movie . "" target israel and we will target you . . . you have be warn . "" yoav gallant would also be unable to travel freely . the word he use when announce that israel would besiege gaza have be frequently quote by critic of israel 's conduct . two day after the hamas attack on 7 october , mr gallant say : "" I have order a complete siege on the gaza strip . there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything be close … we be fight human animal and we be act accordingly "" . mr khan write in his statement that "" israel have intentionally and systematically deprive the civilian population in all part of gaza of object indispensable to human survival "" . famine , he say , be present in part of gaza and imminent in other . israel deny there be a famine , claim that food shortage be cause not by their siege - but by hamas theft and un incompetence . if an arrest warrant be grant for ismail haniyeh , the head of the hamas political branch , he will have to think hard about his regular trip to meet senior arab leader . he be likely to spend much more time at his base in qatar , which like israel , do not sign the rome statute that set up the icc . the other two accuse hamas leader , yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , be believe to be hide somewhere inside gaza . an arrest warrant do not add much to the pressure on they . israel have be try to kill they for the last seven month . the warrant would also put mr netanyahu in a category of accuse leader that also include russian president vladmir putin , and late colonel muammar gaddafi of libya . mr putin face an arrest warrant for the unlawful deportation and transfer of child from ukraine to russia . before he be kill by his own people , col gaddafi 's arrest warrant be for murder and persecution of unarmed civilian . it be not attractive company for benjamin netanyahu , the leader of a state that pride itself on its democracy .",israel gaza war: more rafah evacuations as israel steps up operations

"for the leader of both hamas and israel , end the war in gaza have become a deadly game of survival . the term on which the war finally end could largely determine their political future and their grip on power . for hamas leader yahya sinwar , even his physical survival . it be partly why previous negotiation have fail . it be also why the question of how to permanently end the fighting have be put off to the last stage of the plan outline by us president joe biden on friday . that transition between talk on a limited hostage - for - prisoner deal to discussion about a permanent ceasefire would , mr biden acknowledge , be "" difficult "" . but it be also where the success or failure of this late deal be likely to hinge . the us say it have submit a draft resolution to the un security council support the ceasefire plan outline by president biden . the three - phase plan involve an end to the conflict , the release of the hostage and reconstruction of the palestinian territory . israel 's prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , have strong domestic reason for want to take this deal step by step . phase one , as outline by mr biden , would see the release of dozen of hostage , both live and dead . that would be widely welcome in a country where the failure to free all those hold by hamas be , for many , a glaring moral stain on mr netanyahu 's management of the war . but hamas be unlikely to give up its most politically sensitive hostage – woman , wound , elderly – without some kind of guarantee that israel will not simply restart the war once they be home . israel confirm death of four more hostage in gazaleak , quote by israeli medium on monday morning , suggest that benjamin netanyahu have tell parliamentary colleague that israel would be able to keep its option open . that option , to resume fighting – until hamas be "" eliminate "" – be , some believe , the least mr netanyahu 's far - right coalition partner will demand . without their support , he face the prospect of early election and the continuation of a corruption trial . mr netanyahu need to keep his long - term option open , to stand a chance of win their support for any initial hostage deal . hamas leader , on the other hand , be likely to want permanent ceasefire guarantee upfront . previous deal have collapse into this chasm . bridge it now will depend on how much room for manoeuvre mr netanyahu have with his hard - right government ally to find alternative to the "" elimination "" of hamas – and how far hamas leader be prepared to consider they . mr netanyahu talk over the weekend about the destruction of hamas 's "" military and govern capability "" and ensure that the group no long pose a threat to israel . few dispute that hamas have suffer major loss to its military infrastructure – and even , some say , to its public support within gaza and its control of the street . but there be no sign that israel have kill or capture its top leader yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , and leave they free in gaza to celebrate the withdrawal of israeli force would spell political disaster for israel 's embattle prime minister . on monday a us state department spokesman say that although hama 's capability have "" steadily degraded "" in recent month , it remain a threat and the us do not believe the group could be eliminate militarily . meanwhile the white house say mr biden have "" confirm israel 's readiness to move forward with the term that have now be offer to hama "" and say the palestinian group be now the only obstacle to a deal . separately , military spokesman rear admiral daniel hagari say the israeli military would be able to ensure israel 's security in the event of any truce agree by the government . however yanir cozin , diplomatic correspondent with israel 's military radio station , glz , believe that mr netanyahu will not end the war until he can frame it as a success .
