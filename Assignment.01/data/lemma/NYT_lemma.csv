"" [ music play ] in an unexpected speech last week , president biden reveal the detail of a secret proposal intend to end the war in gaza . most surprising be where that proposal have come from . today , my colleague isabel kershner explain biden 's gambit and the difficult choice it present for israel 's leader , benjamin netanyahu . it be wednesday , june 5 . isabel , tell we about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house . so last friday , president biden make a speech . and it come at a pivotal moment in the war because for week beforehand , the whole world have be focus on israel 's long delay invasion of the city of rafah , the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a million displace palestinians have flee to to find refuge from fight in other area of the gaza strip . so understandably , there be huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure come from the white house for israel not to go into rafah . it be just consider way too risky . but for the israelis , they be say the last battalion of hama be there . many hostage be there . and without take control of that area , the israelis feel they would not have accomplish anything . so in the end , they do begin to move into the eastern part of rafah . but then as the israelis be operate in eastern rafah with their tank and ground troop , the israelis on may 26 carry out a strike , an airstrike . this be an attack mean to target two hamas operative . and they do , in fact , strike those two operative and kill they with what they say be the small missile that their jet could carry . unfortunately , that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike take place in be right by a camp of makeshift shack and tent where hundred or thousand of palestinians be shelter . this fire rip through the tent and end up kill 45 civilian accord to the gazan health authority . and it be exactly the kind of disaster that everybody have fear if israel be to operate in this crowd , southern , dusty border town . which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war . that be right . now , we know that the white house , the biden administration , would very much like to see this war come to an end as soon as possible . and then on friday — good afternoon . before I begin my remark — — president biden give a speech . and surprisingly — now to another issue . — this speech when it turn to the israel - hamas war be not about rafah . in fact , it be something totally different and much big . israel have now offer — israel be offer a comprehensive new proposal . it be a road map to an endure ceasefire and the release of all hostage . what president biden describe as the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hama that would end the war . this proposal have be transmit by qatar to hamas . today , I want to lay out his term for the american citizen and for the world . and , isabel , what do he mean exactly by the israeli proposal ? well , there be be a lot of smoke and mirror around this whole process of talk and negotiation between israel and hamas . and , in fact , the last time we see a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release be at the end of last november . but , in fact , there have be this on again , off again attempt at get negotiation back on track over the last few week . and it soon come to light that this be the late israeli proposal that be apparently present . and this proposal it turn out be unanimously approve as a basis for the negotiation by israel 's war cabinet . and here be an american president spell out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television . absolutely . and the israeli public know nothing about this . so what do biden actually say ? what do he say be in this proposal ? ok , well , what he say — this new proposal have three phase . three . he present it as a deal in three phase , which be generally in line with all the previous plan of the last few month . and the first phase would involve a six week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostage — — include woman , the elderly , the wound — — the most vulnerable one — there be american hostage who would be release at this stage . and we want they home . — would be exchange for hundred of palestinian prisoner in israeli jail . and israeli force would be withdraw from population center within the gaza strip . — with 600 truck carry aid into gaza every single day . humanitarian aid would be flow at a much great level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate . so this seem in some way like the temporary ceasefire in november , right ? woman and child , vulnerable hostage , a cease in hostility for six week . what about phase two ? well , here we get to the crucial part because during phase one , the side be suppose to start negotiate phase two . now , I will be straight with you . there be a number of detail to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two . and phase two be suppose to culminate in all remain live hostage release and exchange again for many more palestinian prisoner from israeli jail . this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troop from the gaza strip . and in his speech , president biden do say that as long as hamas live up to its commitment , the temporary ceasefire would become , in the word of the israeli proposal — — the cessation of hostility permanently . "" — essentially mean the end of the war . so biden be actually talk about the end of the war . he be say that out loud , which be not something we have be hear from israel at all , at least publicly . on the contrary , in fact , our colleague write a story at the end of last week when one senior israeli official say the war would last until at least the end of the year . so this be something very new . absolutely . and then we get to phase three because there be a third phase to this plan . and that be move ahead already to the day after the war , which have be keep very vague by the israelis up to now . and the phase that president biden outline be essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza . that be the offer that be now on the table and what we have be ask for . it be what we need . so the president be say that this be a deal that should be accept , that meet the requirement of both side , that can point to a path forward . and he make a couple of point to bolster that — the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they have devastate hamas force . — one of which be that in his view , hamas have already be sufficiently degraded and devastate to the point where , as president biden put it , hamas be no long capable of carry out another october 7 . in other word , that goal of total victory that netanyahu talk about , biden be actually say they have accomplish it . the israelis have accomplish it . not really , actually . he take on netanyahu on the total victory slogan — indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down — will only bog down israel in gaza , drain the economic , military , and human resource and further israel 's isolation in the world . — and say that total victory be a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what do total victory mean ? you can not kill every last hamas operative . and even if you do , presumably there would be many more palestinian who would come to replace they . and in a way , he be use this speech to go over the head of netanyahu and go straight to the israeli people and present they with these term to in a way corner netanyahu , but also to put down the gauntlet to hamas and say , here be the term . they sound very like the term hamas be ask for and put hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though israel be still fight in rafah . it be time to begin this new stage , for the hostage to come home , for israel to be secure , for the suffering to stop . it be time for this war to end , for the day after to begin . thank you very much . so biden be essentially say here , listen . israel , you have win the war effectively . hamas be degraded . now it be time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have design . what be the reaction inside israel ? the initial reaction take a while to come because president biden make his speech . and it land at about 8 : 30 in the evening on friday israel time . and this be the time where many , many family be sit around their sabbath dinner table , as I be with my family and friend , not watch the news , not look at phone for the most part . observant jews have actually switch off for the sabbath and be not go to hear any news until saturday night . and as the news do begin to trickle out , it really shake israel up . and this leave netanyahu in a great bind because for month , he be really be play for time and juggle compete interest and really not have to make a decision one way or the other on what come next . we have be hear that rafah be really the last stronghold of hamas , and this be something the military have to do . but after that , there be just a kind of void and no news on the hostage or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon . and so when this speech be make , suddenly it shake up everything . and netanyahu be suddenly face a very crucial choice . we will be right back . so , isabel , you say that this be a very important moment for netanyahu , that now he really be face a choice . what do he do ? what do he come out and say ? so his office actually put out a statement . and his first response be that israel be stick to its objective of the destruction of hamas 's military and govern capability . and he say the actual proposal put forward by israel would allow israel to uphold these principle . now , this be a slightly ambiguous response that you could pass in different way . he be not exactly deny that this be an israeli proposal . and indeed , we quickly learn that , in fact , israel 's war cabinet have unanimously vote on the general outline of what president biden have present . he be not deny it . but the one thing miss from that statement be this declaration we would be hear for month on end that the war would not end until there be total victory . that have go . so total victory have go , which be a difference , which mean potentially the war goal have shift a little bit . well , the way he articulate it be talk about the degradation or dismantling of hama 's capability as oppose to talk about the total elimination of hamas as a movement . and then he follow up . his office put out another statement on saturday , also still during the sabbath , which be a little strong . he say under the proposal , israel would insist on its condition be meet , these same war objective , before a permanent cease fire be put in place and that any suggestion that israel would agree to that permanent ceasefire before the condition be meet would be a non - starter . but again , it be kind of conditional and could be interpret in different way . at what point do one declare that the capability have be dismantle or sufficiently degraded ? so it leave a lot of room for maneuver . and so what be netanyahu up to here , isabel ? I think he be try to balance all these compete side . he be seem to be try not to torpedo the chance of this deal but at the same time to be able to hang on politically when he have a very serious challenge loom within his government should this deal go ahead . so tell I about that challenge . israel 's government be form of a coalition of party . netanyahu 's likud be the main party . but it totally rely for its majority in parliament on its partner in the coalition . and they include two ultra - orthodox party and two far right party . and the far right party have both come out explicitly say that should this deal as outline by president biden go ahead , they will not be party to it . so netanyahu face this real political danger on his right . that be right . so there be the leader of these two right wing party who he rely on for his coalition government . he rely on they for his majority in parliament . and the leader of those party be itamar ben - gvir , who be the national security minister , and bezalel smotrich , who be currently the finance minister . now , neither of these party nor their leader be sit in the much more tight and small war cabinet that actually oversee and direct and make the decision on the course of the war in gaza . they be see as way too extreme to be part of that forum . that forum be much more reflective of the national consensus . but these party be part of the broad government . and they have threaten not only to oppose the deal as outline by president biden should it go ahead . but they have actually vow if it do go ahead , they would withdraw their support to netanyahu and bring his government down . and if his government be to collapse as a result , he would then be face a new election . now , he have be try to stave off the end of the war and the prospect of new election ever since october 7 because then he be in danger of face that public reckoning for the perceive failure that the government 's policy failure , the military 's failure , the intelligence failure lead up to the hamas lead attack of october the 7 . but we really might be get to crunch time when it come to his political lifeline here . so this be a pretty dramatic moment for netanyahu then , right ? I mean , he be under tremendous pressure from biden , his big ally . biden be basically ask he to choose between this deal , which mean the end of the war , something his coalition partner , these hard right guy , really do not want , and his own power essentially , right ? stay alive politically or the end of the war and the hostage come home . that be a very stark choice . absolutely . and then there be other choice that he have to weigh because israel have be increasingly isolate and under international censure for its prosecution of the war in gaza . netanyahu himself be face the prospect of possible arrest warrant be put out against he from the international criminal court in the hague . israel be in the dark on a genocide case in the international court of justice in the hague . so should he go ahead with this deal , he have be offer sweetener like an invitation to address congress . and this would in a way be a way of bring he back into the fold . so , isabel , say netanyahu approve this proposal . how likely be it that the right wing , smotrich and ben - gvir , actually do leave the government ? I mean , they would be give up power , too , no ? they would . and if we look at all the opinion poll be do in israel in the last few month , bezalel smotrich and his religious zionism party for one would barely scrape back into parliament in another election . and therefore , there be a lot at stake for he , too , and for itamar ben - gvir because if the next government that be form be not go to be a right wing and far right government , he would find himself out of power , too . but , isabel , let us say they do leave . what happen in that scenario ? well , the assumption be that the government would collapse . it would lose its majority . and naturally , the knesset would vote to dissolve itself and set a date for a new election , which would have to come within five month . and during that period , this government would turn into a caretaker government . now , usually a caretaker government that be a transitional one in that period before election be not suppose to make dramatic decision for the country . but be a caretaker government during wartime , this put israel in uncharted political territory . then theoretically , if we be to ask could such a government even approve a deal once it have be negotiate , even without the support of those far right party , apparently there would still be enough in favor to see it through . interesting . so it seem like there be a lot of possibility for how this could go . but it do in a way rely on netanyahu decide what israel 's course will be . and it seem like he probably need to land on one of these option . what do you think he be go to do ? well , it might not end up be black and white , take the deal or not take the deal . we might end up see something in between because I think netanyahu , who be face huge public pressure to bring back those hostage who still be alive , would definitely want to move ahead with at least that first part of the deal that would see a six week temporary ceasefire in return for the most vulnerable hostage . and then you get into the much tricky part of that negotiation for the next stage , which would involve essentially end the war . and it could be that we might see netanyahu want to proceed with this deal but only partially and then get to a point where it can not go far . and netanyahu be probably very keenly aware of the american political timetable . there be skeptic here who say that by labor day , all the american attention be go to be focus on america 's own internal politic run up to the november election and that netanyahu basically just have to survive another 90 day to get to that point , at which point the pressure subside . so this be a scenario in which he just basically run out the clock . he keep on that tightrope . that be a possibility , absolutely , and one that he would be very adept at do if the past be anything to go by . ok , so there be a number of way netanyahu could actually handle this . how should we think about what biden have really accomplish here ? well , I think it be hard to say that one speech be go to change the course or the outcome of this war . but it certainly have crystallize the issue and bring they out into the light after month and month of murkiness that netanyahu be able to in a way hide behind and operate within . and I think now he be in the spotlight . and assume that hamas be willing to accept and go along with this negotiation for this proposal , the israeli public 's expectation have certainly be rise now toward a deal . and all eye be now on netanyahu to see which way he will go . isabel , thank you . thank you so much . in an interview with "" time magazine "" publish on tuesday , biden be ask whether netanyahu be prolong the war in gaza in an effort to hold on to office . biden say , quote , "" there be every reason for people to draw that conclusion . "" we will be right back . here be what else you should know today . on tuesday , republican lawmaker in arizona vote to put a ballot measure before voter in november that would make unlawfully cross the border from mexico a crime in the state . the move would put the border crisis directly onto the ballot in a key swing state , potentially fire up anti - immigration conservative voter . it be similar to a law pass in texas early this year , currently hold up in court after it be challenge by the biden administration . and the result of a major election in india have be tally . and they be deeply disappointing for india 's prime minister narendra modi . modi appear to have secure a third consecutive term in office . however , his bjp party do not deliver the landslide victory it have promise and even lose its majority in parliament . now modi and the bjp must come to an agreement with other party in order to form a coalition government in india 's parliamentary system . today 's episode be produce by will reid , eric krupke , and sydney harper . it be edit by brendan klinkenberg and michael benoist , contain original music by marion lozano , diane wong , dan powell , and rowan niemisto , and be engineer by chris wood . our theme music be by jim brunberg and ben landsverk of wonderly . that be it for "" the daily .

"" [ music play ] in an unexpected speech last week , president biden reveal the detail of a secret proposal intend to end the war in gaza . most surprising be where that proposal have come from . today , my colleague isabel kershner explain biden 's gambit and the difficult choice it present for israel 's leader , benjamin netanyahu . it be wednesday , june 5 . isabel , tell we about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house . so last friday , president biden make a speech . and it come at a pivotal moment in the war because for week beforehand , the whole world have be focus on israel 's long delay invasion of the city of rafah , the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a million displace palestinians have flee to to find refuge from fight in other area of the gaza strip . so understandably , there be huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure come from the white house for israel not to go into rafah . it be just consider way too risky . but for the israelis , they be say the last battalion of hama be there . many hostage be there . and without take control of that area , the israelis feel they would not have accomplish anything . so in the end , they do begin to move into the eastern part of rafah . but then as the israelis be operate in eastern rafah with their tank and ground troop , the israelis on may 26 carry out a strike , an airstrike . this be an attack mean to target two hamas operative . and they do , in fact , strike those two operative and kill they with what they say be the small missile that their jet could carry . unfortunately , that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike take place in be right by a camp of makeshift shack and tent where hundred or thousand of palestinians be shelter . this fire rip through the tent and end up kill 45 civilian accord to the gazan health authority . and it be exactly the kind of disaster that everybody have fear if israel be to operate in this crowd , southern , dusty border town . which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war . that be right . now , we know that the white house , the biden administration , would very much like to see this war come to an end as soon as possible . and then on friday — good afternoon . before I begin my remark — — president biden give a speech . and surprisingly — now to another issue . — this speech when it turn to the israel - hamas war be not about rafah . in fact , it be something totally different and much big . israel have now offer — israel be offer a comprehensive new proposal . it be a road map to an endure ceasefire and the release of all hostage . what president biden describe as the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hama that would end the war . this proposal have be transmit by qatar to hamas . today , I want to lay out his term for the american citizen and for the world . and , isabel , what do he mean exactly by the israeli proposal ? well , there be be a lot of smoke and mirror around this whole process of talk and negotiation between israel and hamas . and , in fact , the last time we see a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release be at the end of last november . but , in fact , there have be this on again , off again attempt at get negotiation back on track over the last few week . and it soon come to light that this be the late israeli proposal that be apparently present . and this proposal it turn out be unanimously approve as a basis for the negotiation by israel 's war cabinet . and here be an american president spell out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television . absolutely . and the israeli public know nothing about this . so what do biden actually say ? what do he say be in this proposal ? ok , well , what he say — this new proposal have three phase . three . he present it as a deal in three phase , which be generally in line with all the previous plan of the last few month . and the first phase would involve a six week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostage — — include woman , the elderly , the wound — — the most vulnerable one — there be american hostage who would be release at this stage . and we want they home . — would be exchange for hundred of palestinian prisoner in israeli jail . and israeli force would be withdraw from population center within the gaza strip . — with 600 truck carry aid into gaza every single day . humanitarian aid would be flow at a much great level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate . so this seem in some way like the temporary ceasefire in november , right ? woman and child , vulnerable hostage , a cease in hostility for six week . what about phase two ? well , here we get to the crucial part because during phase one , the side be suppose to start negotiate phase two . now , I will be straight with you . there be a number of detail to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two . and phase two be suppose to culminate in all remain live hostage release and exchange again for many more palestinian prisoner from israeli jail . this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troop from the gaza strip . and in his speech , president biden do say that as long as hamas live up to its commitment , the temporary ceasefire would become , in the word of the israeli proposal — — the cessation of hostility permanently . "" — essentially mean the end of the war . so biden be actually talk about the end of the war . he be say that out loud , which be not something we have be hear from israel at all , at least publicly . on the contrary , in fact , our colleague write a story at the end of last week when one senior israeli official say the war would last until at least the end of the year . so this be something very new . absolutely . and then we get to phase three because there be a third phase to this plan . and that be move ahead already to the day after the war , which have be keep very vague by the israelis up to now . and the phase that president biden outline be essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza . that be the offer that be now on the table and what we have be ask for . it be what we need . so the president be say that this be a deal that should be accept , that meet the requirement of both side , that can point to a path forward . and he make a couple of point to bolster that — the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they have devastate hamas force . — one of which be that in his view , hamas have already be sufficiently degraded and devastate to the point where , as president biden put it , hamas be no long capable of carry out another october 7 . in other word , that goal of total victory that netanyahu talk about , biden be actually say they have accomplish it . the israelis have accomplish it . not really , actually . he take on netanyahu on the total victory slogan — indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down — will only bog down israel in gaza , drain the economic , military , and human resource and further israel 's isolation in the world . — and say that total victory be a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what do total victory mean ? you can not kill every last hamas operative . and even if you do , presumably there would be many more palestinian who would come to replace they . and in a way , he be use this speech to go over the head of netanyahu and go straight to the israeli people and present they with these term to in a way corner netanyahu , but also to put down the gauntlet to hamas and say , here be the term . they sound very like the term hamas be ask for and put hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though israel be still fight in rafah . it be time to begin this new stage , for the hostage to come home , for israel to be secure , for the suffering to stop . it be time for this war to end , for the day after to begin . thank you very much . so biden be essentially say here , listen . israel , you have win the war effectively . hamas be degraded . now it be time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have design . what be the reaction inside israel ? the initial reaction take a while to come because president biden make his speech . and it land at about 8 : 30 in the evening on friday israel time . and this be the time where many , many family be sit around their sabbath dinner table , as I be with my family and friend , not watch the news , not look at phone for the most part . observant jews have actually switch off for the sabbath and be not go to hear any news until saturday night . and as the news do begin to trickle out , it really shake israel up . and this leave netanyahu in a great bind because for month , he be really be play for time and juggle compete interest and really not have to make a decision one way or the other on what come next . we have be hear that rafah be really the last stronghold of hamas , and this be something the military have to do . but after that , there be just a kind of void and no news on the hostage or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon . and so when this speech be make , suddenly it shake up everything . and netanyahu be suddenly face a very crucial choice . we will be right back . so , isabel , you say that this be a very important moment for netanyahu , that now he really be face a choice . what do he do ? what do he come out and say ? so his office actually put out a statement . and his first response be that israel be stick to its objective of the destruction of hamas 's military and govern capability . and he say the actual proposal put forward by israel would allow israel to uphold these principle . now , this be a sligh",biden’s push to end the war in gaza

"" late last week , an effort to get food into northern gaza turn deadly , as thousand of desperate gazan descend on aid truck and israeli troop task with guard those truck open fire . but exactly how people die and who be responsible remain contest . today , my colleague hiba yazbek on what we know about what happen and what it tell we about hunger in gaza . it be tuesday , march 5 . so hiba , we be now in the fifth month of israel 's war against hamas in gaza . and for week , we have be hear about negotiation over a cease fire and a hostage exchange . then , late last week , there be a disaster surround an aid convoy that be bring into gaza . you have be report on what happen . tell we about it . so last thursday , there be a deadly disaster involve civilian , possibly the deadly disaster since the war start nearly five month ago , in which 118 palestinians be kill and more than 760 be wound in gaza city . but there be conflicting report on how they die and what exactly happen . the israeli military have one account of what happen and the gaza health ministry and witness have another account . so my colleague and I start dig into the detail . we start call people , piece together a picture of what have actually happen there . and what do you find when you guy start really look into this ? so first , let I just give you the context of what happen . this happen in northern gaza , the place that have be at war the long . that be where israeli ground force begin their invasion of the gaza strip . many people have leave the north . but we do know that some 300 , 000 people be still there . the people who have remain there be really live through very desperate condition . very little aid have come in to the north of gaza since the war start and especially in recent week . food be barely available for the people who have remain there . the un have be warn of a famine that be loom over the territory . hiba , why be there so little aid get into northern gaza in particular ? well , first of all , there be less aid get into the gaza strip in general , not just the north . there be multiple reason as to why that be . but one of the main reason be that israel itself have be very slow to approve permit and often deny permit for aid truck and aid convoy to come in , specifically to the north . because israel say that they do not want the aid to end up in the hand of hamas , that they do not want they to get a hold of the package . get it . when israel do approve the permit and the aid truck start their journey , there be multiple hurdle that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people . some of these hurdle include the widespread destruction in gaza . there be vast damage across the gaza strip . road have be destroy , there be rubble everywhere , and it be very difficult for the truck to actually move through that rubble and through those road . then these aid convoy have to go through multiple israeli checkpoint on the way . there be often significant delay at these checkpoint by israeli soldier who be inspect the aid . this make it hard for the truck to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they be give . sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they get delay so much that they can not keep go . hm . but there be a particular problem with the north , where fighting have be go on the long . the civil order be now break down , essentially . we know that frequent israeli strike on palestinian policeman mean that there be really no one to run security for official group and for aid convoy , leave they vulnerable to attack by local gang who be try to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it , and also , hungry and desperate civilian who be try to grab the aid and take as much as they can , which mean that they end up steal some of it , loot some of it , while it be still on the way . right . so it be lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown . I mean , this be kind of the downstream effect of extended war in a particular place . there be a power vacuum . that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely . right . the few aid truck that do come in have have to either suspend their aid delivery into the north or have not be able to deliver aid there . the last time unrwa , the un agency in charge of palestinian refugee , try to bring truck to the north be nearly a month ago . but they say that one of their convoy come under fire . another major aid provider , the world food program , say that they have not deliver aid there in over three week . they cite all of the reason we talk about for this suspension . so while aid have not be come into the north , people have be grow more desperate and hungry and the situation there have be get bad , which have be raise international alarm . there be be increase call on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the resident there . so israel partner with these local palestinian businessman in gaza , and they promise to secure the aid convoy that the businessman would supply and that would make their way into the north . they successfully do this three time last week . so people start be very hopeful that more would come , and ahead of the fourth delivery , they start to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north . that bring we to thursday 's incident . [ music play ] so last thursday around 4 : 45 am , around 38 aid truck reach this distribution point . they start get close to the crowd of people who have camp there overnight wait for this aid to come . when the people see the truck come , they be very desperate . they surround they . they get on top of they . then at some point , israeli soldier start fire shot . then it turn violent very fast . it end with 118 palestinians dead and 760 injure . this be where the account diverge . ok . so let us start with the israeli account . what do they say happen ? so the israeli military say that it be try to secure the convoy and it have tank nearby to make sure that the convoy reach the area . it do acknowledge that its troop have open fire at the crowd , but they say that they open fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approach their troop and endanger their life . they say the shot that be fire be not really the reason why so many people die , but the reason that so many people die be because , in the chaos of all of it , they trample each other and many have die from suffocation or trampling , and also that the truck have run over some of the people who be try to run away . oh , god . so the israelis do not deny actually shoot , but they say it be more about control the crowd , kind of as warn shot type thing , and that this be not the way people actually die . they say the way people actually die be suffocation or be crush by the aid truck themselves . right . what do the gazan health authority say ? so the gazan health authority have actually be call this the flour massacre , or the massacre of the hungry stomach . because what they be say be that israeli force fire at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who be wait for aid . witness and palestinians who be there have say that although some people be trample and possibly run over by the truck , that be not the main reason for the high death toll . most of the people who be injure or kill be injure and kill by israeli fire . so the gazan health authority be essentially say this be a massacre by israel . right . do we know , hiba , what actually do happen ? what have you guy find in your reporting ? well , the israeli military release drone footage that it claim show a mass stampede in which gazan be trample . but that video only add to the confusion of the sequence of event . the quality and the length of the clip make it more difficult to confirm these claim . right . it be just grainy . there be no sound . you see people scramble and run , but you do not understand why . right . the drone footage be heavily edit . it leave out key moment . but it do show hundred of people circle around the truck and hope to catch a bag of flour . then suddenly , we see people start to panic and run in multiple direction . then they release another clip in which we see two israeli tank that be position about a quarter mile down the road . then we see about a dozen body lie around they . we see people crawl and duck for cover . [ crowd noise ] but we do have another video that be release by al jazeera . [ gunfire ] and it show a crowd near the aid convoy . and it also capture the sound of gunfire and show multiple tracer round , which be a special type of ammunition that help troop fine tune their target when it be dark . the tracer round originate from the direction of a nearby israeli military base . so although that do not conclude that the shot come from the direction of the israeli military , it do add another layer of evidence . so hiba , it sound like these video be suggestive but not conclusive . but what do the people you speak to on the ground say , the eyewitness and survivor and doctor you speak with . right . we speak to witness and survivor as well as doctor at the hospital that have take in the people who be wound and kill . they say that most of the people have die or be wound by gunshot . the doctor who run one of the four main hospital in the area that take in the casualty tell I that out of the 13 people who be kill and the 170 people who be wound that the hospital take in , all of the injury be of gunshot wound . he say that they do not see any injury that coincide with those of a stampede or people be run over by truck . that account echo the one that we have hear from witness and people who be there , who see people get shoot and fall to the ground next to they . but in the chaos of everything , people be not check who be dead and who be wound . they be just take the flour , and they be run for their life . and although the account differ on both side , what we do know be that many hungry and desperate people die while try to get food and secure aid in a place where famine be loom and starvation be rampant . that be what I spend the last few week report on . I be try to understand how people in the north of gaza specifically be survive with such little food . we will be right back . so hiba , I want to talk about what people be do to survive in northern gaza . but before we get to that , what be the big picture on the state of hunger in gaza ? hunger have reach unprecedented level in gaza and specifically in northern gaza . we be start to already see report of child die from malnutrition and dehydration . this week , the health ministry say that 15 child have die from malnutrition and dehydration at just one of northern gaza 's hospital . wow , 15 child have actually die ? yes . we also have the un and aid organization say that one in six child in northern gaza be acutely malnutritioned and that more than 90 percent of child under two be face severe food poverty . the un humanitarian coordinator say that a quarter of all gazan resident be one step away from famine . how exactly be people survive , hiba ? I mean , you be talk to people in northern gaza . what be they say ? I have be report on hunger for week . I have talk to people about what they be do in order to survive with such little food . [ non - english speech ] . [ non - english speech ] . I recently talk to one woman whose experience be very typical in northern gaza . her name be ghada krayem . she be a 23 - year - old woman from the north who stay in the north and do not flee . tell I about ghada . [ non - english speech ] . ghada be one of 10 kid . she have six sister and three brother . she be actually gaza 's first female solar power engineer . she be win many award internationally . she be also the sole provider for her family . she be use the money that she win from these grant and competition to help her family through this war . with that money , she actually stockpile a bunch of food in the beginning of the war , expect the situation to deteriorate . she buy flour and milk and can food and everything they might need . they stockpile it in their home . how be it that they be still in northern gaza ? well , actually , they try to stay in their home for as long as they possibly could , until the ground fighting really basically reach their doorstep . [ non - english speech ] . at one point , early on during israel 's ground invasion of the north — [ non - english speech ] . — israeli soldier come to their building and they force they out . they ask everyone to leave the building , and they detain all of the man and the boy , who be later release . she be force to leave with nothing . they take nothing with they , like many other gazan . and they move . they move 12 time since . wow . one of those time be to the south , where they get there and they realize that it actually be not much safe . it be not well for they . so they realize that they should probably just go back to the north and stay as close as possible to their home in case they be able to go back later . but that never happen because israeli force take up their home as a military base and they be there for two week , she say . [ non - english speech ] . after they would leave , two week later , she go back to check on her home . it be burn . there be nothing leave , include the food that she would stockpile . now she be shelter with 50 member of her extended family , include child , in a two bedroom apartment in the north . 50 people in a two bedroom apartment ? that be extraordinary . so what do they do for food early in the war ? well , she tell I that in the beginning of the war , they still be able to find some thing to buy and eat , like rice and vegetable . but — [ non - english speech ] . she say that by the end of december , basically , when aid to the north become less frequent and thing that they be eat have start to run out , include flour , which become much less available and much more expensive . they do not know what to do . I mean , they have nothing to eat , so they start mix water with starch to eat . they be have one meal a day . and the child be constantly hungry , so they have to find an alternative . that alternative be animal food . [ non - english speech ] . so she tell I that they start grind up , really , any animal food that they could find . so rabbit food and bird food and hay and fodder , really anything that they could get their hand on . they would use that to make bread with . but the bread be very dry , and it smell bad , it taste bad , and it make their stomach hurt . but she say that the one that be the bad for she be the bird food . [ non - english speech ] . she say the bird food taste and smell as if you be sit with a bunch of chicken . the smell be very bad and the taste be even bad . [ non - english speech ] . but she tell I that even though this stuff taste and smell bad , they really try to make it as less awful as possible . she tell I that one of her cousin shelter with she love to bake , and she make really tasty sweet before the war . so basically , she try to make the most out of these ingredient . she be make dessert use the corn mill and the rabbit food . she be also make other savory dish that they like and they eat frequently before the war . [ non - english speech ] . she use the animal feed to make maftoul , which be the palestinian version of couscous . so she be make it with the ground up animal feed ? yes . but that be still not enough . at that point , ghada and her family be only eat one meal a day and that be not enough for they or the child in the family . [ non - english speech ] . [ non - english speech ] . she tell I that her little sister , two - year - old elene , who be actually the young person shelter with they , be hungry all the time . she be go to sleep cry and wake up cry . and she love milk , but they run out of milk more than two month ago . so what they have be do be basically give she expire juice . it be actually not even juice , it be a concentrated juice that they would mix with water . because it be expire , it be make she sick . but that be the only thing that they could give she in place of milk . when they be able to , they would give her sugar cane that they would find in the market and lemon as a snack . sometimes when those be not even available , they would just give her gum to chew on and stop cry , to silence her hunger . [ non - english speech ] . so I ask she if they have be able to get any aid since the war start . she tell I that her brother muhammad , who be 30 year old , have be go to the distribution site and sleep on the beach just wait for aid . he would leave at 7 : 00 in the morning and come back at 3 : 00 am . he sleep there for three day this week . so her brother have be sleep on the beach in hope that there would be aid drop off here . so what happen ? so after wait for hour near the distribution site on thursday , he see the eight truck come . and along with the crowd , he run towards they . suddenly , when the chaos erupt , he just start see people drop to the ground . he be actually deaf and mute . so he do not know what be happen . he just see people get shoot and fall to the ground in front of he . she tell I that he see someone get shoot in the head right next to he . god . in the middle of all the chaos and the bloodshed , he be actually able to grab a bag of flour . he just take it and start run really fast . he be just try to get away and hold on to that bag of flour that he be able to get . while leave the site , he see this little kid who be also able to grab a bag of flour . but she say that he tell she that the kid be stop by local gang member who have attack he and grab the bag of flour from he . they steal it from he . ghada 's brother just keep run until he get home , finally . he come home after three day of sleep in the sand with a bag of flour . god , a terrifying night . mhm . but that be the first time they have have flour in month , since december , basically . so obviously , they want to make bread . but that bag be a 25 kilogram bag of flour . again , they be 50 people shelter in one apartment . so they have to make it last they as long as possible so it could feed all the member of the family . so actually what they be do now be they be mix the flour with animal feed still . they be do one cup of flour with three cup of animal feed to stretch it out for as long as possible . they be make bread with it . wow . she say that it be well , but still not normal bread . it be not what they be crave . [ non - english speech ] . they have be through so much since the war start . they have see people kill . they have see dead body . they have be displace 12 time . they have lose friend and family member . but she say that now with the hunger and the starvation in the north , it be really the bad thing they have go through since the beginning of the war . she say that she be see people , kid who be rummage through trash , try to find anything to eat . so she say that people be still go back to that same distribution site . she even say that more people be go back on the beach and waiting and camping out and sleep there , hope for more aid to come . she also say that her brother , muhammad , be also go back every day since thursday , hope to get another bag of flour . because he be so hungry that he want to eat anything , and risk his life for a bag of flour be worth it . despite the fact that so many people have die on thursday try to get flour , the fact that some people do come home with a bag of flour , that be enough for they and other to go back there in hope that more be go to come .

"" late last week , an effort to get food into northern gaza turn deadly , as thousand of desperate gazan descend on aid truck and israeli troop task with guard those truck open fire . but exactly how people die and who be responsible remain contest . today , my colleague hiba yazbek on what we know about what happen and what it tell we about hunger in gaza . it be tuesday , march 5 . so hiba , we be now in the fifth month of israel 's war against hamas in gaza . and for week , we have be hear about negotiation over a cease fire and a hostage exchange . then , late last week , there be a disaster surround an aid convoy that be bring into gaza . you have be report on what happen . tell we about it . so last thursday , there be a deadly disaster involve civilian , possibly the deadly disaster since the war start nearly five month ago , in which 118 palestinians be kill and more than 760 be wound in gaza city . but there be conflicting report on how they die and what exactly happen . the israeli military have one account of what happen and the gaza health ministry and witness have another account . so my colleague and I start dig into the detail . we start call people , piece together a picture of what have actually happen there . and what do you find when you guy start really look into this ? so first , let I just give you the context of what happen . this happen in northern gaza , the place that have be at war the long . that be where israeli ground force begin their invasion of the gaza strip . many people have leave the north . but we do know that some 300 , 000 people be still there . the people who have remain there be really live through very desperate condition . very little aid have come in to the north of gaza since the war start and especially in recent week . food be barely available for the people who have remain there . the un have be warn of a famine that be loom over the territory . hiba , why be there so little aid get into northern gaza in particular ? well , first of all , there be less aid get into the gaza strip in general , not just the north . there be multiple reason as to why that be . but one of the main reason be that israel itself have be very slow to approve permit and often deny permit for aid truck and aid convoy to come in , specifically to the north . because israel say that they do not want the aid to end up in the hand of hamas , that they do not want they to get a hold of the package . get it . when israel do approve the permit and the aid truck start their journey , there be multiple hurdle that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people . some of these hurdle include the widespread destruction in gaza . there be vast damage across the gaza strip . road have be destroy , there be rubble everywhere , and it be very difficult for the truck to actually move through that rubble and through those road . then these aid convoy have to go through multiple israeli checkpoint on the way . there be often significant delay at these checkpoint by israeli soldier who be inspect the aid . this make it hard for the truck to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they be give . sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they get delay so much that they can not keep go . hm . but there be a particular problem with the north , where fighting have be go on the long . the civil order be now break down , essentially . we know that frequent israeli strike on palestinian policeman mean that there be really no one to run security for official group and for aid convoy , leave they vulnerable to attack by local gang who be try to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it , and also , hungry and desperate civilian who be try to grab the aid and take as much as they can , which mean that they end up steal some of it , loot some of it , while it be still on the way . right . so it be lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown . I mean , this be kind of the downstream effect of extended war in a particular place . there be a power vacuum . that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely . right . the few aid truck that do come in have have to either suspend their aid delivery into the north or have not be able to deliver aid there . the last time unrwa , the un agency in charge of palestinian refugee , try to bring truck to the north be nearly a month ago . but they say that one of their convoy come under fire . another major aid provider , the world food program , say that they have not deliver aid there in over three week . they cite all of the reason we talk about for this suspension . so while aid have not be come into the north , people have be grow more desperate and hungry and the situation there have be get bad , which have be raise international alarm . there be be increase call on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the resident there . so israel partner with these local palestinian businessman in gaza , and they promise to secure the aid convoy that the businessman would supply and that would make their way into the north . they successfully do this three time last week . so people start be very hopeful that more would come , and ahead of the fourth delivery , they start to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north . that bring we to thursday 's incident . [ music play ] so last thursday around 4 : 45 am , around 38 aid truck reach this distribution point . they start get close to the crowd of people who have camp there overnight wait for this aid to come . when the people see the truck come , they be very desperate . they surround they . they get on top of they . then at some point , israeli soldier start fire shot . then it turn violent very fast . it end with 118 palestinians dead and 760 injure . this be where the account diverge . ok . so let us start with the israeli account . what do they say happen ? so the israeli military say that it be try to secure the convoy and it have tank nearby to make sure that the convoy reach the area . it do acknowledge that its troop have open fire at the crowd , but they say that they open fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approach their troop and endanger their life . they say the shot that be fire be not really the reason why so many people die , but the reason that so many people die be because , in the chaos of all of it , they trample each other and many have die from suffocation or trampling , and also that the truck have run over some of the people who be try to run away . oh , god . so the israelis do not deny actually shoot , but they say it be more about control the crowd , kind of as warn shot type thing , and that this be not the way people actually die . they say the way people actually die be suffocation or be crush by the aid truck themselves . right . what do the gazan health authority say ? so the gazan health authority have actually be call this the flour massacre , or the massacre of the hungry stomach . because what they be say be that israeli force fire at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who be wait for aid . witness and palestinians who be there have say that although some people be trample and possibly run over by the truck , that be not the main reason for the high death toll . most of the people who be injure or kill be injure and kill by israeli fire . so the gazan health authority be essentially say this be a massacre by israel . right . do we know , hiba , what actually do happen ? what have you guy find in your reporting ? well , the israeli military release drone footage that it claim show a mass stampede in which gazan be trample . but that video only add to the confusion of the sequence of event . the quality and the length of the clip make it more difficult to confirm these claim . right . it be just grainy . there be no sound . you see people scramble and run , but you do not understand why . right . the drone footage be heavily edit . it leave out key moment . but it do show hundred of people circle around the truck and hope to catch a bag of flour . then suddenly , we see people start to panic and run in multiple direction . then they release another clip in which we see two israeli tank that be position about a quarter mile down the road . then we see about a dozen body lie around they . we see people crawl and duck for cover . [ crowd noise ] but we do have another video that be release by al jazeera . [ gunfire ] and it show a crowd near the aid convoy . and it also capture the sound of gunfire and show multiple tracer round , which be a special type of ammunition that help troop fine tune their target when it be d",a deadly aid delivery and growing threat of famine in gaza

"" [ music play ] early this week , the top prosecutor of the international criminal court request arrest warrant for israel 's prime minister and its defense minister . the move shock israelis and set up a possible showdown between the world 's top criminal court and israel , together with its big ally , the united states . today , my colleague , jerusalem bureau chief patrick kingsley , explain . [ music play ] it be thursday , may 23rd . [ music play ] so , patrick , early this week , there be a pretty surprising announcement by the international criminal court in the hague . it have to do with israel and hamas . tell we what happen . well , on monday morning , we be all take by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the icc , the international criminal court , the top criminal court in the world . it try individual accuse of war crime . and the chief prosecutor announce that he be request arrest warrant for five individual involve in the war between israel and hamas for crime against humanity . three of they be from hamas — yahya sinwar , the head of hamas within gaza , the hamas military commander , and the political leader of hamas , who be base in qatar . but maybe the big news in this announcement be that the chief prosecutor be seek the arrest of two of israel 's top leader — benjamin netanyahu , the prime minister , and yoav gallant , the defense minister . and this be a massive bombshell . these two man be leader from a major us ally . they be in regular contact with the us government , and they be be implicitly equate with the three top leader of an organization , hamas , that many consider a terrorist organization . and this equation send shockwave through israeli society and , indeed , around the world . so this be absolutely remarkable , patrick . I mean , I , for one , be quite surprised by see this . I want to dig into it with you . so who be this prosecutor behind these request for these warrant ? and how do he reach this decision to go for they in the first place ? so the prosecutor 's name be karim khan , and he be a british lawyer , a british barrister . he be 54 . he be lead a very impressive career . he have spend year work on human right case , both defend people and also prosecute in such case . he be involve in tribunal relate to the war surround the breakup of the former yugoslavia , rwanda . he investigate islamic state crime in iraq . and in 2021 , he be appoint the top prosecutor at the icc . and what be his responsibility as top prosecutor ? well , it be his job to travel the world and investigate allegation of human right abuse , war crime , crime against humanity , and in the process , play a key role in decide who get prosecute at the international criminal court . the icc and the icc prosecutor investigate and try people who would not be pursue by the judicial system within their country of origin . it step in when it seem like the domestic authority in any give country be not do their job . and last year , he famously go after president putin in russia in connection with the war in ukraine . so at what point do this prosecutor , karim khan , turn his attention to israel and gaza ? well , he actually inherit an investigation from his predecessor that be look at israel 's conduct and also that of hamas during a previous war in 2014 between the two side . but then that get supersede on october 7th by the horror that we see that day commit by hamas and then by the scale and damage cause by israel 's bombing campaign in its counterattack . and we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what hamas have do in early october , but also grow criticism and condemnation of what israel and its air force do in its response . you will remember that early this year , the international court of justice , a separate court also in the hague , begin to address claim that israel be and be commit a genocide in gaza , a claim that israel strongly deny . right . that be the case that south africa bring . we do an episode about that . yes , exactly . so as the world 's attention focus on this new conflict , so do karim khan 's . also today , the international criminal court 's chief prosecutor , karim khan , qc , have wrap up a visit to israel and the occupy west bank . khan have visit the region to investigate if war crime be commit on october 7th . we start to see he arrive in israel visit some of the site that hamas attack last year , talk to survivor , talk to leader , review security camera footage , and so on . I have just come from the border of the rafah crossing , and we could see gaza , at least we could see crane that be on the territory of gaza . and he also visit the rafah cross between egypt and gaza , talk to palestinians . at the ministry of justice in ramallah , the chief prosecutor of the world 's high court . he go to the israeli occupy west bank , to ramallah , where the palestinian authority be base , build up evidence that lead to this announcement on monday . [ music play ] today , I be file application for warrant of arrest before pre - trial chamber i of the international criminal court . and he make this very dramatic announcement in a video . my office have diligently collect evidence and interview survivor and eyewitness at the scene of at least six major attack location . flank on each side by two of his deputy . I have reasonable ground to believe that three senior leader of hamas , yahya sinwar , mohammed deif and ismail haniyeh , bear criminal responsibility for the follow international crime . and the accusation that he make against the three hamas leader focus on the violent action that hamas take on october 7th . extermination as a crime against humanity . murder as a crime against humanity . and he walk through a long list of charge stem from the extraordinary violence during that attack . the taking of hostage as a war crime . rape and other act of sexual violence during captivity . and he say there be reasonable ground to believe that hostage take from israel have be subject to sexual violence , include rape , while be hold in captivity . and he cite assessment of medical record , video , and documentary evidence , as well as interview with victim and survivor . and I repeat and underline my call for the immediate release of all hostage take from israel and for their immediate safe return to their family . so this prosecutor see the atrocity on october 7th and then what follow with hama take the hostage , abuse they , as crime against humanity . that be what it amount to in his view ? exactly . and what about the charge against the israelis ? these be slightly different . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and minister of defense yoav gallant bear criminal responsibility for the follow international crime . obviously , a lot of the outcry and horror at the war in gaza have center around israel 's airstrike that have kill ten of thousand of gazan . but karim khan focus not on the military action of benjamin netanyahu and yoav gallant , his defense minister , but on the accusation of — starvation of civilian as a method of warfare . — starvation . the idea that israel have allegedly seek to restrict and block aid delivery , food supply to gaza with the intent to starve the civilian population there . these individual , through a common plan , have systematically deprive the civilian population of gaza of object indispensable to human survival . and that be primarily base on the fact that for the first two week of the war , until october 21st or so , israel block all aid entry to gaza after yoav gallant , the defense minister , one of these two israelis whose arrest mr . khan seek , say that he be impose a total siege on gaza — no food , no fuel , no electricity . and while that total siege be ease towards the end of october , khan also note that there have be continue restriction on essential supply , like food and medicine , ever since . that conduct take place alongside attack that kill civilian , the obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian organization , and attack on aid worker that force many of those same humanitarian organization to either cease operation or limit their life - save effort in gaza . the implication be that the famine that he say be present in some area of gaza and imminent in other area be in part the responsibility of netanyahu and gallant . that starvation have cause and continue to cause death , malnutrition , dehydration , and profound suffering among the population . my office charge netanyahu and gallant as co - perpetrator and as superior in the commission of these allege crime . why be the focus of these charge starvation ? I mean , give that the airstrike , as you say , be in many way really the focus of this war and certainly the focus of the world 's attention on this war , the civilian death from the military operation . why starvation ? karim khan do not explain why he focus on starvation rather than israel 's military tactic , which he mention only in pass . but legal expert have say that it be easy to prove that starvation be use as a method of warfare than it be to prove that there have be any specific crime involve in any specific airstrike . and that be because under the rule of war and international law , it be not necessarily illegal in and of itself to kill civilian during wartime . if a military assess , with the help of military lawyer , that the likely civilian death toll cause by that strike be proportional to the value of the military target , then that , in many case , will be in accordance with the rule of war . if a military can prove that sense of proportionality , then it be actually quite hard to prove that there be any crime commit in the process . so in other word , military action be often weigh quite carefully . in the case of , say , a modern military like israel 's or the united states , there be lawyer that look at these thing . it be not necessarily so easy to prove that something be disproportionate and should be consider a crime . exactly . whereas with the crime of starvation , legal expert say that it be potentially easy to prove that there be some wrongdoing there because yoav gallant , the israeli defense minister , go on record in a public statement , and he announce that there would be a total siege on the territory of gaza . and that be follow by an action , the action of close off gaza 's border for the next two week , and no aid be allow in . during that time , there be restriction on electricity , water , fuel , as well as food . and that be why legal expert think that karim khan have go after israel with the crime of starvation rather than focus on their military operation . but I suppose just think about our coverage , patrick , and the conversation you and I have have , famine and starvation and a civilian population in extreme distress trap in a small piece of territory be also not a small thing , right ? that be also something that make sense that the court would be consider . absolutely , it be a huge thing . people do not have to be hit by an airstrike to be live through an absolutely catastrophic situation . so these charge really seem to spell bad news for israel and for these two israeli leader , netanyahu and gallant . and it be remarkable because these be man who , as you say , be some of america 's close ally . I mean , they be , you know , at the pentagon . they be have meeting with president biden . and now , the chief prosecutor of the icc be say that they be war criminal . yes , it be a very dramatic moment in the view of some people , a turning point , and certainly , we can say that it be one of the harsh rebuke of israel 's wartime conduct since october 7th . [ music play ] but within israel , there be be a very different reaction . and it be not all bad news for benjamin netanyahu . [ music play ] we will be right back . [ music play ] so , patrick , what do israelis make of this announcement ? within israel , the reaction have be very different . whether it be netanyahu 's ally or his critic , there have be almost uniform outrage that the prosecutor for the icc would make these accusation . and it mean that at a time of rise domestic criticism of prime minister netanyahu across the political spectrum , with only a very few exception , everyone have rally behind netanyahu and gallant . despite the fact that netanyahu be increasingly unpopular and even within his own government , there have be grow criticism of his wartime strategy . for example , just two day before the prosecutor 's announcement , one of the senior member of his own wartime cabinet , benny gantz , issue netanyahu with an ultimatum , warn he that he would quit the government if he do not spell out a plan for a post - war gaza . then , suddenly , the announcement come from karim khan that netanyahu and gallant be under investigation . and gantz be one of the first to come out with a condemnation of karim khan and a defense of the israeli government . that be the clear example of how even critic of netanyahu have fall in line , circle the wagon , and present a united front . this be really interesting . so this action by the prosecutor have kind of have the effect of actually close division that be start to appear in israeli society , effectively bring netanyahu 's critic kind of back into his camp , or at least make it hard to criticize he . exactly . and israelis , in general , feel that israel have always be target unfairly , hold to a high standard than many other country , and that this be , once again , another example of that , another example of israel be accuse of thing that other country do but get away with . and there have be broadly three criticism from the israelis of the icc prosecutor . first , the israeli claim be that the icc prosecutor be make a horrible false equivalence between hamas , a terrorist organization , and israel , a democratic state . hamas raid israel and launch the bloody attack on jews in a single day since the holocaust . israel , in the eye of israelis , be fight a righteous response to protect their citizen and to win back the liberty of the hostage that be capture on october 7th . [ music play ] this guy be out to demonize israel . he be do a hit job . and netanyahu himself articulate some of the clear version of this argument when he go on american television . he be create false symmetry , false fact , and he be do a grave injustice to the international court . and he call khan 's decision absurd , an effort to demonize israel and to hold it to far high standard than any other country . he say it would have be as if after 9 / 11 — that be like say after 9 / 11 , well , I be issue arrest warrant for george bush , but also for bin laden . — arrest warrant have be issue for both osama bin laden and george bush . or after , in world war ii , well , I be issue arrest warrant for fdr , but also for hitler . it be a hit job . it be not serious . he be out to defame israel , and he be also pour gasoline — [ music play ] the second criticism from israelis have be about process . the icc be create about two decade ago by a treaty . more than 120 country have sign that treaty , but israel have not . and israel contend that the prosecutor do not have the authority , therefore , to go after israeli political leader . israelis also say that khan do not spend enough time assess whether israel be itself investigate these allegation within its own judicial system . remember that the icc be a court of last resort . it be only suppose to intervene when a domestic judicial system be genuinely not make any effort to investigate the allege crime . and israelis be say that khan do not spend enough time investigate gallant and netanyahu . the icc prosecutor have spend 10 year investigate allege crime commit during a previous war between israel and hamas , but this decision have be issue within just a few month . and israelis be say that khan jump the gun in that sense . so the israelis be say , look , we be try to get to it , but you just do not give we enough time . exactly . and they have even say that khan 's team be suppose to be come this very week to continue that conversation and assess whether israel be genuinely look into these allegation by itself . and that they mislead israel by pretend that they would be make that assessment when , in fact , all along they be plan to request arrest warrant . interesting . so for israeli official , they be see it as a kind of activist thing , as oppose to a neutral judicial decision . that be their claim , at least . the prosecutor 's office say that they have try to sincerely engage with israel on this issue , but that it be become clear to they that israel do not seriously investigate this kind of crime . so you say , there be three element to this . what be the last ? the third and last element be on the content of the claim itself . israel flatly deny that it be responsible for the humanitarian crisis in gaza . it even deny that there be a famine or that the situation be on the point of a famine . it point out all the way in which it have work to get much more aid into gaza since october , include open more crossing , allow the we to create a pier on the shoreline of gaza . it be allow some country to airdrop aid . and certainly , the amount of aid that have go in recent month have dwarf the amount that be go in october and november . and while it accept that its soldier have obstruct and , at time , even kill aid worker , it say that that obscure the fact that it coordinate every day in detail with aid group to facilitate thousand of aid mission every month . be not israel 's argument that these shipment could also include thing that could be very useful for hamas , the group that just kill 1 , 200 of its citizen ? exactly . no one 's disputing , least of all israel , that israeli official be examine all the aid go into gaza . the dispute be about whether that be necessary . israel say it be . it say that if it do not check , then some of these aid convoy might be smuggle in weapon or material that could be use to fight israel , to kill israeli civilian . and that , therefore , israel have no choice but to examine some of these good go in . again , the counterargument be that israel 's check be far more stringent than they need to be and end up prevent the entry of everyday item that pose no military threat . ok , so that be the israeli perspective . how do the united states see the prosecutor 's request here ? I mean , the us , obviously , israel 's big ally . well , the american president , president biden , condemn it in no uncertain term . he say the prosecutor 's decision be outrageous . and he condemn he for draw an implicit equivalence between hamas and the leader of the state of israel . and why do biden come out so strongly against the prosecutor ? we know that humanitarian aid have be a major concern for this administration . so why would biden be so opposed to something that really be call out israel for this aid ? first of all , because israel be a major ally of the united states , and the united states want to show support for its ally . second of all , they fear that this kind of criticism , this kind of intervention , will actually make israel less , rather than more , likely to bring the war to a halt , because the feeling be that it will make israel more defensive and in turn batten down the hatch . the third reason be that the united states , historically , have never be a particular fan of the international criminal court . we mention early that israel do not sign the treaty that create the icc . well , the united states do not do that either . and that be in part because american leader fear that have an international global court undermine american sovereignty . they think it be the role of the american judicial system to investigate american citizen . and there be a fear that with the united states so active militarily in many part of the world , that membership of the court , involvement in the court could pave the way for american soldier be try for act on behalf of the united states . and that could somehow dent american foreign policy goal across the world . ok , so the united states do not really like this court , you know , have troop in a lot of place , do not want a court swoop in and prosecute they when something go wrong . but I guess the question then , in my mind , patrick , be do what this prosecutor be do matter ? I mean , america be not a signatory . israel be not a signatory . so why be this important ? well , for the time being , its meaning be more symbolic than anything else . first , karim khan have not issue an arrest warrant . he have request an arrest warrant for these five people . and three judge will now spend week and possibly month decide whether to uphold those request . that process can be less than a month . in the case of vladimir putin , it be just shy of a month . president bashir of sudan be issue with a warrant . that process take roughly a year . when and if they do do that , however , there will be practical effect . if an arrest warrant be issue , it mean that any country that be a member of the international criminal court , in theory , should arrest any of these individual if they enter their territory . that include more than 120 country all over the world , much of europe , latin america , africa , and so on . yes , it be true that the united states and israel be not signatory , and neither be turkey or qatar , two of the country where hamas official spend much of their time when they be outside gaza . so there will still be place for official on either side of these accusation to travel to . but there be lot of other country , like france , italy , both place where benjamin netanyahu travel in the past year , where , in theory , they will not be able to set foot . so the negotiation over the war can still continue , but if netanyahu travel to france or to italy , he could be arrest , which be pretty wild . yes , at least that be the theory . the national authority in any give country still have to make a choice about whether they want to follow through with it . but would those country perhaps not arrest he out of deference to the united states ? I think the expectation be that if we get into this scenario , then someone like netanyahu simply just would not travel to such a country . but the truth be , we just do not really know . we be enter unchartered water . so this be really isolate netanyahu in the world . should it go forward ? yes , isolate netanyahu and to some extent israel itself . and it have not just practical implication for the physical movement of netanyahu and his defense minister , gallant , but it also compound israel 's relationship with foreign ally . it complicate israel 's ability to arm itself . more country may grow more unwilling to sell israel arm , or at least they will face grow pressure because of this decision not to do so . and it also could force the country to become ever more reliant on the united states as it become more of a pariah over its action in gaza . which , of course , put the united states in an even tricky position with an ally who be be pretty hard to be friend with of late . right . and in truth , while the practical consequence of this move be still unknown , they do , in general , compound the sense that israel be face more and more diplomatic consequence for its action . more than a decade ago , a former israeli prime minister warn that israel would face what he call a diplomatic tsunami if its conflict with the palestinians go unresolved . [ music play ] and it be possible that year later we be start to finally see what he mean . israel do still have its supporter , many of they , but we be also now see during this war a level of criticism that go above and beyond the kind that we have grow use to seeing direct at israel over the year . [ music play ] in addition to the warrant request we have see this week , we have obviously have an extraordinary wave of protest on american campus and elsewhere in the world . and early this year , we have a watershed moment when the international court of justice begin hear accusation of genocide against israel . and this week , several european country recognize palestine as a state . wow . so if the tsunami have not yet arrive , we can at least say that the wave be get strong . [ music play ] patrick , thank you . thank you . [ music play ] on wednesday , the leader of spain , norway , and ireland announce that they would recognize an independent palestinian state . the move be largely symbolic , but raise the concern that if neighboring country follow their lead , europe could become a counterweight to the american position that statehood for palestinians should come only from a negotiate settlement with israel . [ music play ] we will be right back . [ music play ] here be what else you should know today . nikki haley , the former united nations ambassador who drop her republican presidential bid in march , say on wednesday that she would vote for donald trump but stop short of officially endorse he . haley be trump 's long stand rival in the 2024 primary contest and have carve out an important lane for herself as the voice for voter look for an alternative to the former president . her decision on whether to endorse he could play a pivotal role in the race . haley have build a formidable network of high - dollar donor and a solid base of college - educate voter that trump need to win . and the city of uvalde , texas , have reach a settlement with most of the family of child who be shoot by a gunman at robb elementary school in 2022 . to avert a lawsuit , the city promise to overhaul the city 's police force , create a permanent memorial to the victim , and pay $ 2 million .

"" [ music play ] early this week , the top prosecutor of the international criminal court request arrest warrant for israel 's prime minister and its defense minister . the move shock israelis and set up a possible showdown between the world 's top criminal court and israel , together with its big ally , the united states . today , my colleague , jerusalem bureau chief patrick kingsley , explain . [ music play ] it be thursday , may 23rd . [ music play ] so , patrick , early this week , there be a pretty surprising announcement by the international criminal court in the hague . it have to do with israel and hamas . tell we what happen . well , on monday morning , we be all take by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the icc , the international criminal court , the top criminal court in the world . it try individual accuse of war crime . and the chief prosecutor announce that he be request arrest warrant for five individual involve in the war between israel and hamas for crime against humanity . three of they be from hamas — yahya sinwar , the head of hamas within gaza , the hamas military commander , and the political leader of hamas , who be base in qatar . but maybe the big news in this announcement be that the chief prosecutor be seek the arrest of two of israel 's top leader — benjamin netanyahu , the prime minister , and yoav gallant , the defense minister . and this be a massive bombshell . these two man be leader from a major us ally . they be in regular contact with the us government , and they be be implicitly equate with the three top leader of an organization , hamas , that many consider a terrorist organization . and this equation send shockwave through israeli society and , indeed , around the world . so this be absolutely remarkable , patrick . I mean , I , for one , be quite surprised by see this . I want to dig into it with you . so who be this prosecutor behind these request for these warrant ? and how do he reach this decision to go for they in the first place ? so the prosecutor 's name be karim khan , and he be a british lawyer , a british barrister . he be 54 . he be lead a very impressive career . he have spend year work on human right case , both defend people and also prosecute in such case . he be involve in tribunal relate to the war surround the breakup of the former yugoslavia , rwanda . he investigate islamic state crime in iraq . and in 2021 , he be appoint the top prosecutor at the icc . and what be his responsibility as top prosecutor ? well , it be his job to travel the world and investigate allegation of human right abuse , war crime , crime against humanity , and in the process , play a key role in decide who get prosecute at the international criminal court . the icc and the icc prosecutor investigate and try people who would not be pursue by the judicial system within their country of origin . it step in when it seem like the domestic authority in any give country be not do their job . and last year , he famously go after president putin in russia in connection with the war in ukraine . so at what point do this prosecutor , karim khan , turn his attention to israel and gaza ? well , he actually inherit an investigation from his predecessor that be look at israel 's conduct and also that of hamas during a previous war in 2014 between the two side . but then that get supersede on october 7th by the horror that we see that day commit by hamas and then by the scale and damage cause by israel 's bombing campaign in its counterattack . and we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what hamas have do in early october , but also grow criticism and condemnation of what israel and its air force do in its response . you will remember that early this year , the international court of justice , a separate court also in the hague , begin to address claim that israel be and be commit a genocide in gaza , a claim that israel strongly deny . right . that be the case that south africa bring . we do an episode about that . yes , exactly . so as the world 's attention focus on this new conflict , so do karim khan 's . also today , the international criminal court 's chief prosecutor , karim khan , qc , have wrap up a visit to israel and the occupy west bank . khan have visit the region to investigate if war crime be commit on october 7th . we start to see he arrive in israel visit some of the site that hamas attack last year , talk to survivor , talk to leader , review security camera footage , and so on . I have just come from the border of the rafah crossing , and we could see gaza , at least we could see crane that be on the territory of gaza . and he also visit the rafah cross between egypt and gaza , talk to palestinians . at the ministry of justice in ramallah , the chief prosecutor of the world 's high court . he go to the israeli occupy west bank , to ramallah , where the palestinian authority be base , build up evidence that lead to this announcement on monday . [ music play ] today , I be file application for warrant of arrest before pre - trial chamber i of the international criminal court . and he make this very dramatic announcement in a vid",i.c.c. prosecutor requests warrants for israeli and hamas leaders
